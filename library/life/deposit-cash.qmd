These companies deliver a machine to your location (machines ~$2,500), and have installers come to set it up ($350 for installation). This takes about 2 weeks. 

I know the guy who owns the restaurant Ella Funt in Soho. Something like this would be perfect.

### Step 2 | Set it up

All ATMs must be connected to the processing server and have a power outlet. There are three optional connections:
1. Hardwire Internet Line
2. Phoneline
3. Purchase an ATM Wireless Box

You can not connect to wireless internet in the business, you must hardwire into the internet via an ethernet jack or run an ethernet cord from the modem to the ATM. 

### Step 3 | Paperwork

Then you fill out some forms with the ATM company ("Exhibit 2, Exhibit 3, W9") that do basic background checks: if you have any fraud in your past, etc.

The paperwork will give you your own unique merchant ID, which allows you into the processing server. We handle getting this licensing done for you. 

Connect your account with them to a (business) bank account. The ATM company sets up an interface for you to monitor transactions, get notifications that the cash balance is low, etc.
