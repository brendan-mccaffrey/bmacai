[Verse 1]
If the feds check up on me, i'ma crash out
spent a bag on some shitters, watch me cash out
might spend another 50 bands, on my left wrist
I wont drop a fucking penny, on my main bitch


[Chorus]
Dumping bags on retail, banging on the opps
fading all these jeets, I can't talk to no cops
Just spun the block i'll prolly spin again, lemme check the price
I'm a real stepper, walk my shit, talk to me nice 

[Verse 2]
i aint paying taxes on these gains cuz im too slimy
the boy young, rich, and turnt, you know i stay smiley
internet money off some shitters up 200 X 
this me talking humble lil bro imagine i flex

[Chorus]
Dumping bags on retail, banging on the opps
I be fading all these jeets, I can't talk to no cops
Just spun the block i'll prolly spin again, lemme check the price
I'm a real stepper, walk my shit, talk to me nice

this some light work now imagine my best shit 
wrote this while whipping the roadster electric

Getting money, getting faded, shit, this bullrun too nice
I copped a richard mill, I aint even know the price.
Respect for nobody, im coming for ya head
I got internet money all that paper shit is dead

[Verse 2]
I got 13 hoes, and they all with the shits
down to up this shit if i dont get a bag off some bits
bitch keep that tooly in your purse, and take off your clothes
nah not me, already hit, baby come meet the bros

[Chorus]
Getting money, getting faded, shit, this bullrun too nice
I copped a richard mill, I aint even know the price.
Respect for nobody, im coming for ya head
I got internet money all that paper shit is dead
