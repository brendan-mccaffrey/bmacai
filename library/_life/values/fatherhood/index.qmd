I intend for this to be an accumulation of knowledge, opinions, and advice for my future self when I have the honor of raising children.

## The little things for my son


- "I love you"
- "It's okay to be angry or upset, but it's not okay to stay that way."
- "Respect and take care of your mother"
- "To get what you want, you must deserve what you want"
- "Nothing is free"
- "I don't know everything. No one does."
- "I am proud of you."
- "Be a gentleman and stand your ground"
- "Stop listening to what people say and watch what they do"
- 'You will be happiest when building your mind, body, family, and business'
