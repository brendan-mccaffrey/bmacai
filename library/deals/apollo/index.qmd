2 sided partnership

Venues
- bars
- restaurants
- venues
- hotels

Consumers
- digital passport/wallet
- connects to venues



Increase consumer loyalty for vendors

Reservations: Resy, opentable, etc
Tickets: Dice, ticketmaster, etc

Markets are very fragmented, want to unify data, create relationships at scale

Tiktok, etc, has very good data intelligence - enable very good ad targeting
Comparing this to offline world, there's no comprehensive solution for the business or the consumer
