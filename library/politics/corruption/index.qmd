#### UN, Zakharov 

The son of Alexander Zakharov, mastermind of Russia's killer drones that attack civilians in Ukraine, is now interning at the U.N.'s disarmament institute. UNIDIR says he was selected through a "competitive and transparent recruitment process...on the basis of his qualifications, skills and experience for the position."

[Tribune de Geneve:](https://twitter.com/tdgch) "The presence of Zakharov's son in Geneva implies that Switzerland issued him with a visa, which is compulsory for Russian nationals wishing to enter and stay in the country. When questioned, the Swiss State Secretariat for Migration would not comment on the case. Alexander Zakharov's son did not respond to our messages."
