### Backpropogation

Backpropogation is an algorithm for training neural-networks, used to update its weights to minimize the 'loss'

1. Network makes a prediction on a batch of input data
2. Loss is calculated between predicted and actual output
3. Gradient of the loss with respect to the weights are calculated using the chain rule of differentiation
4. The gradients are used to update the weights in the opposite direction of the gradient, reducing the loss
5. Repeat the process until the loss reaches a satisfactory level or a maximum number of iterations
