[10 galaxies that existed just 830 million years after the Big Bang](https://esawebb.org/images/aspire1/)

The seven galaxies [highlighted in this image](https://esawebb.org/images/protocluster-1/) from the NASA/ESA/CSA Telescope have been confirmed to be at a distance that astronomers refer to as redshift 7.9, which correlates to 650 million years after the big bang. This makes them the earliest galaxies yet to be spectroscopically confirmed as part of a developing cluster.
