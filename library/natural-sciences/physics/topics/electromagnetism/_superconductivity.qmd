### Summary

Superconductivity is a quantum mechanical phenomenon wherein certain materials, when cooled below a specific critical temperature, lose all electrical resistance and expel magnetic fields. The result is the unhindered flow of electric current, manifesting remarkable properties such as zero resistance and perfect diamagnetism. Initially discovered in simple elements like lead and mercury, superconducting properties have since been found in various alloys and complex materials.

The phenomenon of superconductivity was first discovered by Dutch physicist Heike Kamerlingh Onnes in 1911 while experimenting with mercury at temperatures close to absolute zero. Subsequent decades led to the development of multiple theories, with John Bardeen, Leon Cooper, and John Schrieffer collectively proposing the BCS Theory in 1957. This theory described how electrons form "Cooper pairs" in a lattice, facilitating the zero-resistance state. In 1986, the discovery of high-temperature superconductors by Georg Bednorz and K. Alex M√ºller ushered in renewed interest and research because these materials could superconduct at temperatures much higher than those required for simple elements.

Superconductivity is highly important because of its transformative implications for energy transmission and storage. Its properties can potentially revolutionize fields ranging from transportation to medical technology. Because superconductors exhibit zero electrical resistance, they offer the potential for incredibly efficient energy transmission systems, minimizing energy loss.

**Applications**

1. **Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)**: Superconducting magnets are fundamental to the high-resolution imaging achievable in modern MRI machines.
2. **Maglev Trains**: Magnetic levitation (Maglev) trains use superconducting magnets for frictionless, high-speed travel.
3. **Particle Accelerators**: Superconductors are crucial for the powerful magnets in particle accelerators like the Large Hadron Collider.
4. **Power Grids**: Superconducting cables can dramatically increase the efficiency of power transmission.
5. **Quantum Computing**: Superconducting circuits form the basis for some types of quantum bits, or "qubits," central to quantum computing.

**Relevant Subtopics**

1. **Type I and Type II Superconductors**: Type I superconductors are pure elements that expel all magnetic fields, whereas Type II superconductors are typically compounds or alloys that allow some penetration of magnetic fields.
2. **Cooper Pairs**: Understanding how electrons pair up to move through the lattice structure of superconductors without scattering is essential to understanding the phenomenon.
3. **BCS Theory**: Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer Theory is the quantum mechanical explanation for superconductivity in conventional superconductors.
4. **High-Temperature Superconductors**: These materials can superconduct at temperatures much higher than conventional superconductors, albeit still at very low temperatures by everyday standards.
5. **Josephson Junctions**: These are thin insulating barriers or weak links between superconductors, and they exhibit unique quantum behaviors.
6. **Vortices in Type II Superconductors**: When magnetic fields penetrate a Type II superconductor, they do so at discrete points and form vortices, which has its own area of study and applications.
7. **Applications and Devices**: From SQUIDs (Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices) to fault current limiters, many devices utilize superconducting properties for various applications.

## LK-99

**The story of the (alleged) first room-tempurature ambient-pressure superconductor.**

Superconductivity is a magic phenomenon that permits leviatation, lossless energy transfer & storage, and countless other beautiful technologies to exist. There are known materials who are superconductors at low tempuratures, and the room tempurature superconductor has been a holy grail of materials science for many decades.

In July, 2023, a pre-print journal out of South Korea claimed to have discovered the "First Room-Temperature Ambient-Pressure Superconductor". The paper generated a ton of excitement, a newfound interest in materials science, and much discussion of room temp SC implications.

...but the paper is (and always has been) just noise.
