## TLDR

Superconductivity is a magic phenomenon that permits leviatation, lossless energy transfer & storage, and countless other beautiful technologies to exist. There are known materials who are superconductors at low tempuratures, and the room tempurature superconductor has been a holy grail of materials science for many decades.

In July, 2023, a pre-print journal out of South Korea claimed to have discovered the "First Room-Temperature Ambient-Pressure Superconductor". The paper generated a ton of excitement, a newfound interest in materials science, and much discussion of room temp SC implications.

...but the paper is (and always has been) just noise.


## Timeline

July 22: 

- [The First Room-Temperature Ambient-Pressure Superconductor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12008)
- Original paper(s) is(are) released twice, the first time (suspected to rush to beat the second) with only 3 authors, making the team eligible for a noble prize.

July 26: 

- [I predict](https://twitter.com/0xbmac/status/1684338975459233792?s=20) the superconductor hype ("we are so fucking back") is all noise.

July 27: 

- Douglas Natelson publishes a [blog post](http://nanoscale.blogspot.com/2023/07/condensed-matter-on-public-stage-and.html) expressing a pessemistic view on the whole debacle.
- Condensed Matter Theory Center deconstructs ["the non-experimental parts of the Korean room temp SC claims."](https://twitter.com/condensed_the/status/1684551820293681153?s=20)

Hype ensues, and magnifies, as people rush to replicate the study/results.

July 29: 

- [First-principles study on the electronic structure of $Pb_{10âˆ’x}Cu_x(PO_4)_6O (x=0, 1)$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16040)

July 31: 

- [Synthesis of possible room temperature superconductor $LK-99:Pb_9Cu(PO_4)_6O$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16402)

A (failed?) replication attempt out of Beijing; shows semiconductor behavior, not super

A theoretical explanation for LK-99 is [released](https://twitter.com/sineatrix/status/1686182852667572224) on July 31, 2023, by [Sinead Griffin](https://twitter.com/sineatrix) out of Berkeley.

Group claims/proves LK-99 is a ferromagnet (NOT a superconductor)
