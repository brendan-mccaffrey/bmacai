## Overview

Special relativity, published by Einstein in 1905, deals with the physics of motion in the absence of gravitational fields. It is based on two postulates:

1. The laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames of reference, meaning they hold true for all observers moving at constant speeds relative to each other.
2. The speed of light in a vacuum is the same for all observers, regardless of the motion of the light source or observer.

Special relativity introduced the concept that space and time are intertwined into a single continuum known as spacetime. It led to several groundbreaking conclusions, such as time dilation (time slows down for objects in motion relative to a stationary observer), length contraction (objects in motion contract in the direction of motion from the viewpoint of a stationary observer), and the equivalence of mass and energy, expressed by the famous equation $$E=mc^2$$.
