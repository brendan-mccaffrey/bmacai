### Yukawa Coupling

The coupling used with the Higgs field to create a fundamental mass is the Yukawa coupling. In the Standard Model of particle physics, the Higgs field interacts with fermions (particles with half-integer spin, such as quarks and leptons) through the Yukawa coupling. The Yukawa coupling is a term in the Lagrangian of the Standard Model that describes the interaction between the Higgs field and fermions.

The Yukawa coupling takes the form:

$$\mathcal{L}_{Yuk} = -y_f \bar{f}_L \Phi f_R + h.c.$$

where $y_f$ is the Yukawa coupling constant for the fermion $f$, $\bar{f}_L$ is the left-handed component of the fermion field, $\Phi$ is the Higgs field, and $f_R$ is the right-handed component of the fermion field. The left-handed and right-handed components of the fermion field transform differently under the electroweak gauge group, and this leads to a mass term for the fermion after the Higgs field acquires a vacuum expectation value.

The Yukawa coupling is responsible for generating the masses of the fermions in the Standard Model. The strength of the coupling determines the mass of the fermion - the larger the Yukawa coupling, the larger the mass of the fermion. The Yukawa couplings have been measured experimentally and are one of the key parameters of the Standard Model.

### Fermions

Fermions are a type of elementary particle that obey the Fermi-Dirac statistics, which dictate their behavior under quantum mechanics. They are named after Enrico Fermi, an Italian physicist who made significant contributions to the development of the theory of quantum mechanics.

Fermions are one of the two fundamental types of particles in the universe, the other being bosons. While bosons have integer values of spin, fermions have half-integer values of spin. This fundamental difference between fermions and bosons has important implications for their behavior under different physical conditions.

Fermions are subject to the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. This means that if two fermions have the same set of quantum numbers, they cannot occupy the same energy level and must occupy different energy levels instead. This principle has important implications for the behavior of fermions in systems with many particles, such as atoms and solids.

Fermions include particles such as electrons, protons, and neutrons, which make up the matter in the universe. They also include other elementary particles, such as quarks and leptons, which are the building blocks of matter. The behavior of fermions is essential to many areas of physics, including condensed matter physics, particle physics, and cosmology.
