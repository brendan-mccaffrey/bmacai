## Context

This is notes on a lecture by Eric Weinstein on the topic of geometric unity. The lecture is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZQZQZQZQZQ).

I am first watching this lecture without a proper background in tensor calculus, dirac notation, or differential geometry. My plan is first to listen, ponder curiously, explore the topics which I need to learn, and return once I'm able to independently generate an opinion with conviction.

### The Current Idea of Physics

Edward Witten gave 3 main insights/assumptions, they correspond to the 3 great equations

**(1) Physics takes place in an arena**

That arena is a manifold `x` together with some kind of semi-Riemannian metric structure: something that allows us to take length and angle, so that we can perform measurements at everypoint in spacetime or higher dimensional structure.

The equation associated with this is the Einstein Field Equation.

$$ R_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2} R g_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8 \pi G}{c^4} T_{\mu\nu} $$

- $R_{\mu\nu}$ is the Ricci tensor, which encodes information about the curvature of spacetime.
- $R$ is the Ricci scalar, a measure of the overall curvature of spacetime.
- $g_{\mu\nu}$ is the metric tensor, which describes the geometry of spacetime.
- $\Lambda$ is the cosmological constant, which represents the energy density of the vacuum of space.
- $G$ is the gravitational constant, which determines the strength of the gravitational interaction.
- $c$ is the speed of light in vacuum, which sets the scale for the relationship between space and time.
- $T_{\mu\nu}$ is the stress-energy tensor, which describes the distribution of matter and energy in spacetime.

**(2) Symmetry groups are fundamental.**
They cannot be deduced from any structure inside the arena. They are additional data that come to us "out of the blue", wihtout any explanation. These symmetries create a non-abelian group, which is currently:

$$\mathrm{SU}(3) \times \mathrm{SU}(2) \times \mathrm{U}(1)$$

*def.* **non-abelian group**: sometimes called a non-commutative group, is a group in which there exists at least one pair of elements a and b of G, such that a ∗ b ≠ b ∗ a.

This has a corresponding curvature equation, that says the curvature of an auxillary structure known as a guage potential, when differentiated in a particular way, is again equal to "the amount of stuff in the system that is not directly involved in the equation above".

$$d^*_A F_A = J(\psi)$$

- $d_A$ is the exterior covariant derivative associated with the connection A. It is a generalization of the standard exterior derivative to take into account the nontrivial connection structure of the gauge field.
- $F_A$ is the curvature 2-form of the connection A. It encodes the non-Abelian nature of the gauge field and is given by the commutator of the connection 1-forms.
- $d_A^*$ is the adjoint of the exterior covariant derivative, known as the codifferential. It maps p-forms to (p-1)-forms and is defined with respect to the metric on the underlying spacetime manifold.
- $J(\psi)$ is the source term associated with a spinor field ψ. It is usually expressed in terms of the Dirac equation, which relates the spinor ψ to a massless field that obeys the wave equation. The source term J encodes the coupling of the spinor to the gauge field, and in the case of the electromagnetic field, it is proportional to the electric charge of the particle.

The equation $d_A^* F_A = J(\psi)$ is a local differential equation that relates the curvature of a gauge field to the sources that generate it. It is a key ingredient in the formulation of gauge theories such as quantum chromodynamics and the electroweak theory, which describe the strong and electroweak interactions in particle physics. It also has applications in other areas of physics, such as condensed matter physics and general relativity.

**(3) Matter is assymetric and therefore light.**

We have a Dirac equation coupled to a connection

$$ \phi_A \psi = \mu \psi $$

> In this equation, $\psi$ is a spinor field and $\phi_A$ is a differential operator that acts on $\psi$. The index $A$ can represent different kinds of symmetry groups, such as the gauge group in a gauge theory. The equation states that the action of the operator $\phi_A$ on the spinor field $\psi$ yields a scalar multiple of $\psi$ with eigenvalue $\mu$. In other words, $\psi$ is an eigenvector of $\phi_A$ with eigenvalue $\mu$.

> This equation has applications in several areas of physics, such as quantum field theory and condensed matter physics. For example, in condensed matter physics, $\phi_A$ can represent the Hamiltonian of a system, and $\psi$ can represent a wave function that describes the state of the system. The equation then describes how the system evolves over time.

One of the great insights: the reason for the lightness of matter in the natural mass scale of physics has to do with the fact that the psi should have 2 components and the differential operator should map to one component on the other side fo the equation but the mass operator should map to another. So if one of the components is missing, if the equation is intrinsically lobsided (ciral / assymetric), then the amss term and the differential term have difficulty interacting, which is overcompensating for the mass scale of the universe so you get to a point where you have to define a massless equation. Just like overshooting a putt, it's easier to knock it back by putting in a Higgs Field in order to generate an "as-if" fundamental mass through the Yukawa couplings.

**Edward Witten went on to say one more thing**

These three central observations must be supplemented by the idea that this all takes place in quantum mechanical fashion (or quantum field theoretic). 

It's more an after-market assumption rather than one of the core insights.

### Eric's Differences with the Community

Is the quantum in good enough shape that we don't know if we have a serious quantum mechanical problem or not. We know we have a quantum field problem relative to the current formulation of these theories, but we also know in other cases the quantum becomes incredible natural (sometimes almost magically). We don't know if the true theories (the ones we need to be generalizing in some sense) have beautiful quantum mechanical treatments, whereas some of the effective theories we are dealing with now may not survive the quantumization.

Imagine a different sort of incompatability. Take the 3 theories and treat them as 3 vertices of a triangle.

- Einstein GR

- Dirac

- Yang, Mills, Maxwell, Anderson, Higgs

Let's explore the incompatabilities, not at the quantum level, but the geometric input. All 3 of these are geometric theories. What if the incompatability is at the geometry level before the theory is treated quantum mechanically? 

Einstein: We can rewrite by saying there is a
