## Superconductivity

Superconductivity is a quantum mechanical phenomenon wherein certain materials, when cooled below a specific critical temperature, lose all electrical resistance and expel magnetic fields. The result is the unhindered flow of electric current, manifesting remarkable properties such as zero resistance and perfect diamagnetism. Initially discovered in simple elements like lead and mercury, superconducting properties have since been found in various alloys and complex materials.

The phenomenon of superconductivity was first discovered by Dutch physicist Heike Kamerlingh Onnes in 1911 while experimenting with mercury at temperatures close to absolute zero. Subsequent decades led to the development of multiple theories, with John Bardeen, Leon Cooper, and John Schrieffer collectively proposing the BCS Theory in 1957. This theory described how electrons form "Cooper pairs" in a lattice, facilitating the zero-resistance state. In 1986, the discovery of high-temperature superconductors by Georg Bednorz and K. Alex Müller ushered in renewed interest and research because these materials could superconduct at temperatures much higher than those required for simple elements.

Superconductivity is highly important because of its transformative implications for energy transmission and storage. Its properties can potentially revolutionize fields ranging from transportation to medical technology. Because superconductors exhibit zero electrical resistance, they offer the potential for incredibly efficient energy transmission systems, minimizing energy loss.

### **Applications**

1. **Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)**: Superconducting magnets are fundamental to the high-resolution imaging achievable in modern MRI machines.
2. **Maglev Trains**: Magnetic levitation (Maglev) trains use superconducting magnets for frictionless, high-speed travel.
3. **Particle Accelerators**: Superconductors are crucial for the powerful magnets in particle accelerators like the Large Hadron Collider.
4. **Power Grids**: Superconducting cables can dramatically increase the efficiency of power transmission.
5. **Quantum Computing**: Superconducting circuits form the basis for some types of quantum bits, or "qubits," central to quantum computing.

### **Relevant Subtopics**

1. **Type I and Type II Superconductors**: Type I superconductors are pure elements that expel all magnetic fields, whereas Type II superconductors are typically compounds or alloys that allow some penetration of magnetic fields.
2. **Cooper Pairs**: Understanding how electrons pair up to move through the lattice structure of superconductors without scattering is essential to understanding the phenomenon.
3. **BCS Theory**: Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer Theory is the quantum mechanical explanation for superconductivity in conventional superconductors.
4. **High-Temperature Superconductors**: These materials can superconduct at temperatures much higher than conventional superconductors, albeit still at very low temperatures by everyday standards.
5. **Josephson Junctions**: These are thin insulating barriers or weak links between superconductors, and they exhibit unique quantum behaviors.
6. **Vortices in Type II Superconductors**: When magnetic fields penetrate a Type II superconductor, they do so at discrete points and form vortices, which has its own area of study and applications.
7. **Applications and Devices**: From SQUIDs (Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices) to fault current limiters, many devices utilize superconducting properties for various applications.

## Explanation

Superconductivity requires a spin-up electron to pair with a spin-down electron, so that the pair has a net spin of zero and therefore obeys Bose-Einstein statistics, not Fermi-Dirac. This breaks them free from the Pauli exclusion principle, so you can have a great many of them occupying a low energy quantum state that can slide effortlessly through the material like a ghost. Every superconductor relies on exactly that effect.

What differs between materials is the way in which the electrons pair. Electrons don’t like to pair, because of their mutual Coulomb repulsion, but in some materials they can both jiggle the crystal lattice in a way that weakly brings them together, like an arranged marriage for a couple that’s not really into each other. This is called phonon coupling, and can be modeled with BCS theory, at least… for simple crystal structures. That model predicts that superconductivity can only occur up to like 30 K, beyond which the lattice is jostling around too much because of temperature, so the pairing mechanism is disrupted.

However, there are some materials with complicated crystal structures, that get around the assumptions of BCS, and that are more robust when it comes to the effect of temperature on the pairing mechanism. For example, ReBCO, which I work with, can go up to ~90 K. This is a shockingly high number from the perspective of BCS, which is why these materials are called “high temperature” superconductors, despite still having to be pretty cold (liquid nitrogen boils at 77 K). 

Anyway, the high T superconductors have more complicated and exotic pairing mechanisms. It’s no longer “simple” phonon coupling, but something that involves longer-range and more geometrically complicated details, and to this day it’s still not fully understood.

Although, the way supercurrent flows is well-understood, in all superconductors. It’s called the Ginsburg-Landau model, and is based on the idea that there’s some energy associated with electron pair formation, and some energy associated with pair-to-pair interactions, in addition to the usual electromagnetic terms. This model works extremely well, and is the basis for all superconducting technology.

One of the predictions of GL is that, when the condensation energy is nearly zero (around the Tc), there will be fluctuations where electrons temporarily pair and un-pair. These oscillations are extremely rapid, so in experiential measurements they will average out into a state that seems to be kinda superconducting, but not completely. But it’s really just fluctuating, a second-order phase transition. So that’s one cause of the transition width.

Another cause of the transition width is the purity of the sample, or lack thereof. A sample with varying quality throughout will have a wider transition, as some parts of it “turn on” before others. 

With ReBCO, transition widths are typically a few K, with tails noticeable out to like a 10 K span, sometimes more. And dirty samples might have double or triple transitions, if different parts of it are oriented different ways.

Anyway, sorry for the novel of a response, but I hope that provides some context. Any Tc curve on a new superconducting sample is probably going to have quite a wide transition, for lack of sample purity, and also due to the fluctuations that thermodynamically should be there no matter what. So it seems extremely unlikely that a material which somehow superconducts at 4X the temperature of ReBCO would also have a much cleaner Tc transition.

## LK-99

**The story of the (alleged) first room-tempurature ambient-pressure superconductor.**

Superconductivity is a magic phenomenon that permits leviatation, lossless energy transfer & storage, and countless other beautiful technologies to exist. There are known materials who are superconductors at low tempuratures, and the room tempurature superconductor has been a holy grail of materials science for many decades.

In July, 2023, a pre-print journal out of South Korea claimed to have discovered the "First Room-Temperature Ambient-Pressure Superconductor". The paper generated a ton of excitement, a newfound interest in materials science, and much discussion of room temp SC implications.

...but the paper is (and always has been) just noise.
