Lagrangian Mechanics is a reformulation of classical mechanics introduced by Joseph-Louis Lagrange. It uses the principle of stationary action and is particularly powerful in dealing with complex systems and constraints.

## Topics

- **Principle of Stationary Action**: The path taken by a system between two points is the one for which the action is stationary (usually a minimum).
- **Lagrangian**: A function that summarizes the dynamics of the system.
- **Calculus of Variations**: The mathematical foundation of Lagrangian mechanics.
- **Generalized Coordinates**: Coordinates that can include any variables that completely describe the system.
- **Noether's Theorem**: Relates symmetries and conservation laws in Lagrangian mechanics.
