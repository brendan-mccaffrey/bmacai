### Einstein Field Equation

- [paper](https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/tong/gr/four.pdf)

The Einstein field equation is a fundamental equation in general relativity that relates the geometry of spacetime to the distribution of matter and energy. The equation is given by:

$$R_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2}R g_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4} T_{\mu\nu}$$

where $R_{\mu\nu}$ is the Ricci curvature tensor, $R$ is the scalar curvature, $g_{\mu\nu}$ is the metric tensor, $\Lambda$ is the cosmological constant, $G$ is the gravitational constant, $c$ is the speed of light, and $T_{\mu\nu}$ is the stress-energy tensor.

The Ricci curvature tensor $R_{\mu\nu}$ is a measure of the curvature of spacetime, and is related to the distribution of matter and energy through the stress-energy tensor $T_{\mu\nu}$. The scalar curvature $R$ is a measure of the overall curvature of spacetime, and is related to the Ricci curvature tensor through the Einstein field equation.

The metric tensor $g_{\mu\nu}$ is a mathematical object that describes the geometry of spacetime. It specifies the distances between nearby points in spacetime and is used to calculate the curvature of spacetime. The cosmological constant $\Lambda$ is a parameter that was introduced by Einstein to allow for a static universe, but it is now thought to describe the energy density of the vacuum.

The stress-energy tensor $T_{\mu\nu}$ describes the distribution of matter and energy in spacetime. It includes contributions from matter, radiation, and other forms of energy. The equation states that the curvature of spacetime is related to the distribution of matter and energy through the stress-energy tensor.

In summary, the Einstein field equation is a fundamental equation in general relativity that relates the geometry of spacetime to the distribution of matter and energy. It is a mathematical expression of the idea that matter and energy warp spacetime, and that the curvature of spacetime determines the motion of matter and energy.

### Minkowski Metric

In physics, the Minkowski metric (also known as the Minkowski spacetime or the Minkowski metric tensor) is a mathematical tool used to describe spacetime in special relativity. It is named after the German mathematician Hermann Minkowski, who developed the concept of spacetime as a four-dimensional manifold with a metric in the early 20th century.

The Minkowski metric describes the geometry of spacetime in special relativity. It is a mathematical object that assigns a distance or interval between two events in spacetime. In the Minkowski metric, the interval between two events is defined by:

$$ds^2 = -c^2 dt^2 + dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2$$

where $ds$ is the spacetime interval between two events, $c$ is the speed of light, $dt$ is the time interval between the two events, and $dx$, $dy$, and $dz$ are the three spatial intervals between the two events. The minus sign in front of the $c^2 dt^2$ term ensures that the interval is negative for timelike separations, which represent events that can be causally connected, and positive for spacelike separations, which represent events that cannot be causally connected. The Minkowski metric has a signature of (-, +, +, +), which means that the time interval has the opposite sign compared to the spatial intervals.

The Minkowski metric is a special case of the more general metric tensor used in general relativity. In general relativity, the metric tensor is a function of the curvature of spacetime caused by matter and energy, and it is used to describe the gravitational field. However, in special relativity, where there is no gravitational field, the metric tensor is simply the Minkowski metric, and it describes the flat spacetime of special relativity.

- This metric equation is valid under the assumption that light propagates at any location around the BH with constant speed. Thus then spacetime gets extremly curved. But if we assume that spacetime remains flat, then we have to rewrite this as what is the local light propagation velocity tensor.  Under that assumption this velocity will become equal to the EH surface for a location at the EH. Because still remains valid that nothing can exceed the local speed of light, this means that all matter will come at rest at the EH with every particle wave function frozen on that surface. Nothing ever traverses the EH. All accumulates on it. The BH grows by accumulating frozen matter at its EH surface.

- Exactly. In other words, if you take the reference frame of light, you'll see that the EH is pushed to oo, and all matter will be contained between the photon horizon (r=3M) and the EH (r=2M). (Is our universe rotating?)

- You can't take the reference frame of light. In every reference frame the light speed is the same, so "in the reference frame of light" makes no sense because there time is stopped. The EH can't be seen on oo because for an observer between PS and EH there are a finite number of oscillations of his time reference from PS to EH. The assumption that the universe could rotate leads to a complication of all physical laws. We would get that there then has to be a rotation axis of the universe and that all rules are different with relation to that axis so that speed along the rotation direction can exceed c with any multiple without problems of inertia. This is similar to the Hubble expansion with the difference of an absolute rotation axis. That is why I reject both assumptions. It makes no sense to assume that space rotates. We rotate inside space. It also makes no sense to assume that space expands. We shrink inside space. The big one, space, is invariant, flat, not rotating, not translating, not curving. The small, what is inside space, rotates, translates, changes size. The only property of space that has a variation is that the propagation speed of light depends on the mass/energy density distribution in space.

- Isn't it easier for Hawking radiation to escape if black holes have hair? So it's not perfectly curved there. How does this equation differ from the superfluid quantum gravity spinning vortice(s) model of black holes?

- @bgreene marveled about the beauty of the equation. He didn't gave a judgement about its validity. I gave an explanation on what assumptions are needed to allow this metric equation to be applicable. You come with the concept of a radiating BH. That only asks wether a particle pair of matter and antimatter could split such that one falks into, and one escapes the BH. But since the propagation speed of light at the EH is equal to the EH nothing moves there. So a hairy EH would assume that this propagation speed distribution is not smooth. This then should lead to particle wave functions to start from "stand still" and move outward. Such phenomen would need a different metric equation, but would not alter the beauty of the equation that @bgreene mentioned.
