[article](https://www.liberationtimes.com/home/pentagon-unable-to-confirm-or-deny-discovery-of-materials-originating-from-non-human-intelligences-or-unknown-origin-within-secretive-programs)

## Summary 

The blog post discusses the Pentagon's inability to confirm or deny whether its UFO office, known as the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), has discovered any verifiable information to substantiate claims that any current or former U.S. programs have had possession or reverse-engineered materials from non-human intelligences or unknown origin. The Department of Defense (DoD) spokesperson, Susan Gough, stated that the AARO has not discovered any verifiable information to substantiate such claims. However, she declined to comment further on whether the term "extraterrestrial" could extend to materials of unknown origin or non-human intelligences.

## Notes

1. **All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO)**: The AARO is the Pentagon's UFO office. It is currently unable to confirm or deny whether it has discovered any verifiable information to substantiate claims that any current or former U.S. programs have had possession or reverse-engineered materials from non-human intelligences or unknown origin.

2. **Department of Defense (DoD) Stance**: The DoD spokesperson, Susan Gough, stated that the AARO has not discovered any verifiable information to substantiate such claims. However, she declined to comment further on whether the term "extraterrestrial" could extend to materials of unknown origin or non-human intelligences.

3. **Access to Information**: Gough confirmed that the AARO has not been denied access to any U.S. government program, past or present, during the course of its work. She also stated that the AARO may receive all UAP-related information, including any classified national security information involving military, intelligence, and intelligence-related activities, at all levels of classification regardless of any restrictive access controls, special access programs, or compartmented access programs.

4. **Title 50 Authorities**: Gough addressed the issue of Title 50 authorities, stating that such authorities are unrelated to the AAROâ€™s ability to receive all UAP-related information through authorized disclosures.

5. **Public Affairs Policies**: Gough explained that it is DoD policy that all interactions with the news media at the Department level, including press queries, are coordinated with the Office of the Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs. She also noted that her portfolio includes UAP, AARO, and the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence & Security, as well as other issues and offices.

6. **Whistleblower Trust**: The blog post mentions that the AARO, which currently reports to the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence & Security, is not trusted by numerous whistleblowers. The issue may stem from the AARO's proximity to the OUSDI&S, which has previously been criticized for allegedly persecuting whistleblowers.

7. **Conclusion**: The blog post concludes by noting that the National Defense Authorization Act of 2023 means that the AARO should report directly to Deputy Secretary of Defense, Kathleen Hicks, and the Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence on all operational and security matters relating to the AARO. However, there is no indication that this has been implemented yet.
