title: Beat the Casinos

# Principles

- Voltility is your friend. The casinos win in the long run, so take the short run and get out when you're up

- House edge varies across games and in-game bets (pass vs double 3s in craps, for example)

- Understand the difference between theory and practice. There are real life considerations and risks beyond the rules of the games themselves.

- House rules matter. Bet on the banker has lower house edge than the player in baccarat, for example. Some casinos mitigate this with a 5% comission, and some only pay 1.5 to 1 if the winning banker hand is a 6, for example. These rules matter.
