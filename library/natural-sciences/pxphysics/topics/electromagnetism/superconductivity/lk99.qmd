## LK-99

**The story of the (alleged) first room-tempurature ambient-pressure superconductor.**

Superconductivity is a magic phenomenon that permits leviatation, lossless energy transfer & storage, and countless other beautiful technologies to exist. There are known materials who are superconductors at low tempuratures, and the room tempurature superconductor has been a holy grail of materials science for many decades.

In July, 2023, a pre-print journal out of South Korea claimed to have discovered the "First Room-Temperature Ambient-Pressure Superconductor". The paper generated a ton of excitement, a newfound interest in materials science, and much discussion of room temp SC implications.

...but the paper is (and always has been) just noise.

### Timeline of Events

#### **July 22**

- 📑 **Publication**: [The First Room-Temperature Ambient-Pressure Superconductor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12008)
- 📝 **Note**: Original papers are released twice. The first release, suspected to beat the second, includes only 3 authors, making the team eligible for a Nobel Prize.

#### **July 26**

- 🐦 **Prediction**: [I predict](https://twitter.com/0xbmac/status/1684338975459233792?s=20) the superconductor hype ("we are so fucking back") is mostly noise.

#### **July 27**

- 📝 **Blog Post**: Douglas Natelson publishes a [blog post](http://nanoscale.blogspot.com/2023/07/condensed-matter-on-public-stage-and.html) expressing a pessimistic view on the situation.
- 💬 **Commentary**: Condensed Matter Theory Center deconstructs ["the non-experimental parts of the Korean room temp SC claims."](https://twitter.com/condensed_the/status/1684551820293681153?s=20)
- ⏳ **Trend**: Hype ensues and magnifies as people rush to replicate the study/results.

#### **July 29**

- 📑 **Publication**: [First-principles study on the electronic structure of $Pb_{10−x}Cu_x(PO_4)_6O (x=0, 1)$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16040)

#### **July 31**

- 📑 **Publication**: [Synthesis of possible room temperature superconductor $LK-99:Pb_9Cu(PO_4)_6O$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16402)
- 🚫 **Replication Failure**: [Semiconducting transport in $Pb_{10-x}Cu_x(PO_4)_6O$ sintered from $Pb_2SO_5$ and $Cu_3P$](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2307/2307.16802.pdf)

#### **August 4**

- 💡 **Theory**: A theoretical explanation for LK-99 is [released](https://twitter.com/sineatrix/status/1686182852667572224) by [Sinead Griffin](https://twitter.com/sineatrix) out of Berkeley.
- 📑 **Publication**: [Origin of correlated isolated flat bands in copper-substituted lead phosphate apatite.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.16892.pdf)

#### **August 6**

- 📝 **Claim**: Group claims LK-99 is a ferromagnet (NOT a superconductor).
- 📑 **Publication**: [Ferromagnetic half levitation of LK-99-like synthetic samples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03110)
