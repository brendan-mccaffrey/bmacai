## Complexity Theory

"NP" is short for "nondeterministic polynomial-time"

#### **NP-Completeness**

A problem is NP-Complete when

- It is a decision problem, meaning that for any input to the problem, the output is either "yes" or "no".
- When the answer is "yes", this can be demonstrated through the existence of a short (polynomial length) solution.
- The correctness of each solution can be verified quickly (namely, in polynomial time) and a brute-force search algorithm can find a solution by trying all possible solutions.
- The problem can be used to simulate every other problem for which we can verify quickly that a solution is correct. In this sense, NP-complete problems are the hardest of the problems to which solutions can be verified quickly. If we could find solutions of some NP-complete problem quickly, we could quickly find the solutions of every other problem to which a given solution can be easily verified.
