The HGX H100 H100 has 35,000 components and 8 Hopper GPUs. It weighs 60 pounds, and costs $200,000. The compute tray is the first computer with a transformer engine in it.

There's 2 fundamental trends: CPU scaling has ended, and AI has begun (accelerated computing). the tipping point, NVIDIA GPU utilization is high.

**Comparison: $10mm**

- 960 CPUs, consumes 11GWh, 1x LLM
- 48 GPUs, consumes 3.2 GWh, 44x LLM (performance)

### Components

- HGX H100
- Grace Hopper Superchip
- NVLINK Switch
