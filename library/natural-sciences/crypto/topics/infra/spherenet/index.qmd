Arnold Korean 
Luigi Carribiean

building tg since 2015
2020 defi summer
2021 building on solana
spring 2022 started sphere

bonded over internet and math, did eth ico stuff.

Luigi went down finance path, arnold went down IOT path.

They came back together to build something on-chain. Ethereum was too expensive, saw solana was under $0.01 and thought it was able to scale. Only people that were willing to pay were from all over the place, hard to get payments. Wanted an accounting system - is this wallet from kenya or india?

arnold was about to go back to school and luigi was about to work at drift

won hackathon.
