- Mission: Bring turing-completeness to Bitcoin
- Intersection of money revolution (bitcoin) and computing revolution (zk)
- Our first step towards this goal will be a ZK-enabled rollup ecosystem on bitcoin that settles natively through the bitcoin network and provides secure access to BTC.
- In the long term, we believe that a confluence of ZK, native scaling solutions, and innovations on the base layer can bring forth private, scalable and programmable bitcoin-based payments and financial systems that are built directly on bitcoin.

- Bitcoin is most resilient and accessible global settlement layer for internet, but limited by scripting language, Script.
- SNARKs present opportunity to scale bitcoin
- Unlike traditional axiomatic proofs, zk method (interactive proof) is concept of back-and-forth between prover and verifier
- why interactive proofs?
    - reduce communication complexity below cost of the witness
    - convice verifier of correctness without disclosing solution itself
