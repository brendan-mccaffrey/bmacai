- Relayer

`-- datapoint: block_engine_relayer-error,block_engine_url=< discord doesn tlike this>,auth_service_url=<discord doesnt like this> error="auth service failed: transport error"`

this is product of relayer not being used currently due to mempool closure but may be brought back with potential design changes in the future. No reason for alarm
But can add these flags to make the errors go away. Can set --disable-mempool when they start the relayer or use the environement var DISABLE_MEMPOOL=true
