[Aug 6, 7:04am](https://twitter.com/nik_algo/status/1688143969908342784?s=20) YGG "looking spicy" says Nik's quant

[Reported at 9:52am](https://twitter.com/nononsensetrade/status/1688548732244312064) Binance increased the funding rate settlement frequency from 8 hours to 2 hours

[Reminder](https://twitter.com/jtradestar/status/1688543385110396928) that 2018 scam pumps were even crazier

> so much commentary and 'hate' on the YGG situation when people don't remember the summer of 2022 where we had 10x pumps in 1 minute on shitcoins. oh sweet children you haven't experienced the true depths of market manipulation yet
