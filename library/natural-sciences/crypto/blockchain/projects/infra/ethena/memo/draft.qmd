## Introduction

Ethena Labs provides a solution for crypto-native money.

*v2: Ethena Labs provides an internet enabled, crypto native money.*
*v3: Ethena Labs provides crypto native money for the internet economy.*

Ethena offers a censorship-resistant synthetic dollar, $\$USDe$, which is independent of traditional banking system infrastructure. Backed by a variety of delta-neutral derivative positions against staked Ethereum collateral, $\$USDe$ serves as a censorship-resistant safe haven crypto asset. 

Ethena also enables the 'Internet Bond' - a permissionless dollar denominated savings instrument for users worldwide. $\$sUSDe$ derives yield from both the staked Ethereum collateral as well as the basis in futures markets. 

## Deal

Our proposal is to invest ...

## Context

Turing complete blockchains like Ethereum and Solana have enabled a proliferation of assets and applications to form complex crypto economies that operate in parallel to the traditional financial system. Like all mature economies, the crypto-enabled internet economy requires a liquid and stable *medium of exchange*. 

Today, there is over $\$100$ billion of stablecoins in circulation, serving to enhance liquidity, protect users from volatility, and enable certain financial applications. Despite tremendous growth, however, incumbent stablecoins have failed to address a core tenet of crypto - they remain directly dependent on centralized institutions. 

The crypto industry demands a decentralized stablecoin, one which is independent on traditional banking infrastructure.

## Product

Ethena's first product is a decentralized stable crypto asset, $\$USDe$, backed by liquid staked Ethereum and delta-hedged by perpetual swap positions. This structure protects $\$USDe$ from the [centralized points of failure](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/03/11/circles-usdc-endured-1b-of-net-redemptions-since-silicon-valley-banks-shutdown/) of traditional [banking systems](https://dfpi.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/337/2023/03/DFPI-Orders-Silicon-Valley-Bank-03102023.pdf) which [inspired Bitcoin](https://p2pfoundation.ning.com/forum/topics/bitcoin-open-source).

There have been many attempts to deliver a decentralized stablecoin to the market. The attempts can largely be indentified in two categories: overcollateralized stablecoins and algorithmic stablecoins.

MakerDAO pioneered the overcollateralized design with DAI, a stablecoin with X billion in circulation. Although generally successful, DAI has suffered several significant complications in the past, and remains certain downsides.
