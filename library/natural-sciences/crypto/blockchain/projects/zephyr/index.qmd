**Excerpt**

Zephyr has built infrastructure, starting with Venmo email confirmations, to generate Zero-Knowledge proofs of the payment receipts and verify them on-chain. These provide mathematical proof of payments. Therefore, our smart-contract escrow can verify the payment and release the escrowed funds. Because Zephyr relies on Zero-Knowledge proofs, rather than a central entity, it is significantly more secure than traditional escrow service.
