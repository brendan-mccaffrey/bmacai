- can do tg bot out of the gate

- short term loan between trader and solver

## Questions

- how arer assets managed? user with eth on mainnet wants solana, do u create a keypair for them or do they need to give u one? do u give them gas?
    - depends on what users want
    - generic v1 use your own wallets
    - chain sigs on near is closest comp to their account

- do users specify exactly how much they want
- are you guys using skip api for cosmos ecosystem or building ground up / competing
- who can participate in the solver network?
    - v1, small set of solvers: flowdesk, market makers, etc  
    - v2: very wide decentralized solver network

- do u anticipate most interactions going through your frontend, other frontends plugging in ur api, or tg bot?
    - miniapp tech in tg
