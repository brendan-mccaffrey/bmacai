## Overview

Berachain is an EVM compatible blockchain with [Proof of Liquidity](https://docs.berachain.com/learn/#proof-of-liquidity-overview) consensus. Berachain built and uses [Polaris](https://docs.berachain.com/learn/what-is-polaris-evm), a blockchain framework for building EVM-compatible chains on top of the [CometBFT](https://docs.berachain.com/learn/what-is-comet-bft) consensus engine.

### Proof of Liquidity

- BEX LP providers earn BGT, the gov't token used for delegating in Proof of Liquidity.
- Users delegate BGT to validators, who produce blocks based on their delegated stake.
- Validators vote on future BGT inflation across liquidity pools
- Bribes are distributed from validators to delegators
