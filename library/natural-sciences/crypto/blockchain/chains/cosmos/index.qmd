## Cosmos SDK, A Walkthrough

The "Full Node" consists of 

1. The state machine / application
2. Consensus
3. Networking

State machine is connected to consensus through ABCI, and Consensus + Networking are handled by CometBFT.



### CometBFT

[CometBFT](https://docs.cometbft.com/v0.37/introduction/what-is-cometbft#consensus-overview) is an application-agnostic engine responsible for handling the networking and consensus layers of a blockchain. 

- Adopts tendermint consensus
