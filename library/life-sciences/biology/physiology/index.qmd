### Transgender Procedures

**Thrown to the Wolves**

- [A physician reveals the nightmare of transgender ideology in a major children’s hospital.](https://www.city-journal.org/article/transgender-ideology-and-the-corruption-of-medicine)
    - The blog post is an interview with an anonymous physician who works in a major children's hospital in a liberal city. The physician discusses his concerns about the rise of transgender interventions in children and the potential harm they can cause. He criticizes the medical community for adopting transgender ideology without sufficient scientific evidence and for suppressing dissenting views. He also expresses concern about the use of puberty blockers and hormone treatments in children, arguing that these interventions can have irreversible effects and may not be in the best interest of the child.

**Notes**

1. **Transgender Interventions in Children**: The physician criticizes the increasing use of transgender interventions in children, including puberty blockers and hormone treatments. He argues that these interventions are being adopted without sufficient scientific evidence and can have irreversible effects.

2. **Medical Community and Transgender Ideology**: The physician criticizes the medical community for adopting transgender ideology and suppressing dissenting views. He argues that many in the medical community are afraid to question transgender ideology for fear of professional repercussions.

3. **Puberty Blockers and Hormone Treatments**: The physician expresses concern about the use of puberty blockers and hormone treatments in children. He argues that these interventions can have irreversible effects, including permanent changes to the child's sexual organs and hormone balance.

4. **Suicide Risk**: The physician challenges the argument that transgender interventions are necessary to prevent suicide in transgender individuals. He suggests that affirming a child's transgender identity may actually contribute to self-hatred and suicidal ideation.

5. **Future of Transgender Medicine**: The physician is uncertain about the future of transgender medicine. He hopes for a change in the current approach, which he believes is harmful to children.

6. **Role of Psychiatrists, Psychologists, Doctors, Politicians, and Media**: The physician criticizes these groups for promoting transgender interventions in children. He argues that they have convinced children and their parents that these interventions are the correct response to gender dysphoria, despite the potential harm they can cause.

7. **Conclusion**: The physician argues that the current approach to transgender interventions in children is harmful and not in the best interest of the child. He calls for a more cautious approach that takes into account the potential irreversible effects of these interventions.
