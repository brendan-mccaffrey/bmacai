### The Pyramids

Why are the pyramids the topic of so many conspiracies? They are too impressive to make sense.

From Project Untiy:

- The base to height ratio of the Great Pyramid precisely embodies the transcendental number Φ (phi/golden ratio) showing awareness of this construct centuries before Pythagoras.

- Its circumference to height ratio equals 2π (2x pi) which displays sophisticated encoding of this advanced geometrical constant into dimensions.

- Each pyramid side is aligned to precise cardinal directions (N,S,E,W) oriented through surveyed star transits aligned with circumpolar "imperishable stars" that never set below horizons.

- Descending and ascending inner passages appear to geometrically plot key pyramid shadow rays marking exact solar year and equinoxes based on latitude coordinates.

- Limestone, granite, and basalt quarrying, transportation, lifting, and precision placements indicate a mastery of lithic craft, tracing to volcanic confluence zones up and down Nile.

- Granite's piezoelectric properties and heavy metal concentrations suggest functional purpose beyond mere decoration.

- Descending passageway angled at constant 26° matches visual astronomy sightline vectors, facilitating naked-eye celestial observations.

- Casing stone aggregates originally in place but since degraded/damaged/stolen are theorised by some to be able to generate reflective ambient photon-harvesting, used for subtle interior lighting deep within pyramid chambers.

- King's Chamber dimensions, limestone resonances, and granite material properties produce recognisable tonal harmonics in the sub-bass register, perceptible somatically.

- The Great Pyramid's perimeter / height volumetrics encode precise hemispheric dimensions, indicating advanced global earth measurement capabilities via defining 2πR.

- The southern shaft in the Queen's Chamber targets Sirius B - binary companion of Sirius - accurately aligning to its precise celestial coordinates.

- Orientation and offsets follow subterranean fissure fault lines that most efficiently transmit geomagnetic telluric energy.

- Descending passage angles align precisely to Orion's Belt transit paths coded through pyramids, symbolically emphasizing the stars' significance in ancient Egyptian celestial observation traditions.

- Granite within Queen's Chamber displays Core Constellation Pattern Mapping onto the Mazzaroth/Zodiac, according to controversial astro-archaeological researcher Robert Bauval.

- Giza pyramids align diagonally via mysterious narrow underground shafts with sacred temple sites many kilometers away suggestion advanced geospatial stone working powered by geomantic principles.

- The "Bent Pyramid" of Dashur demonstrates precedent stages of architectural experimentation on the way to Giza's apex mark stones, suggesting a long chain of continuity.

- Subterranean chamber dimensions resistant to flooding/cracking showcase ingenious applications determining room length proportionalities for handling massive tonnage loads above without ceiling collapse.

- Descending entrance passages are configured using pi proportional circumpolar geometry symbols, tying celestial observations to ritual movements.

- Limestone electrolysis erosion evidence is suggestive of a massive electrochemical cell vinegar/natron/Nile-Water system

- Granite's high quartz concentration and electromagnetic conductivity properties suggest functional purpose. 

- King's Chamber "niche" dimensions are theorised to project sub-audible infrasonics, research suggests this could produce altered consciousness states.

- Some researchers have proposed that various electromagnetic energy readings recorded within certain chambers inside the Great Pyramid defy conventions of nature.
