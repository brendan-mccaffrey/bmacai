## Neurons Outside the Brain

### The Intestine (Gut)

The intestine had a network of neurons called the enteric nervous system (ENS) which coordinates diverse functions in the intestine.

### The Heart

The human heart has been found to have its own "little brain" - a network of neurons known as the instrinsic cardiac nervous system. It plays a key role in regulating cardiac activity.
