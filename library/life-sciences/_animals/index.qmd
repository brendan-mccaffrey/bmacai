## Barbery Lion

- [Discovery Article: Barbary Lion Facts](https://www.discoveryuk.com/big-cats/barbary-lion-facts-habitat-and-diet/)

The Barbary lion is one of the most spectacular beasts ever to have walked the face of the Earth. Known as the Berber lion, the North African lion, the Egyptian lion and the Atlas lion, this is one of history’s most famous animals. 

In the vast deserts and mountains of the Barbary coast in North Africa, the Barbary lions once roamed freely. With their distinctly dark manes, they were thought to have been one of the largest lion species to have ever existed. These majestic creatures captured the imagination of many, and their historical significance reaches far back into antiquity.

Barbary lions were not only remarkable for their appearance but also for their role in history. These same lions were regularly captured by hunters for the brutal games held in the Roman colosseum. Known as "Damnatio ad bestias" in Latin, this practice was a form of capital punishment where condemned prisoners were executed by Barbary lions and other large cats. The lions' presence in such events added to their mythos and perpetuated their fame.

The decline of the Barbary lion population began with the expansion of the Arab empire from 632 to 1258, leading to the end of the Islamic Golden Age after the Siege of Baghdad by the Mongols. Survivors of that turbulent period claimed that "the waters of the Tigris ran black with ink from the enormous quantities of books flung into the river and red from the blood of the scientists and philosophers killed." Amidst the turmoil in the region and as empires crumbled and fell, the Barbary lions managed to persist until the arrival of European colonists in the 19th century.

During this time, big-game hunting gained popularity, and it proved to be devastating for the already dwindling lion population. As a result, sightings of Barbary lions became scarce, and not a single one was reported from 1901 to 1910. By the 1920s, most scientists believed that they had become extinct in the wild.

There were a few reported sightings in subsequent decades, offering glimmers of hope that some may have survived. In 1948, there was a reported sighting in Morocco, and in 1958, another sighting was claimed in a heavily forested area near the city of Sétif in Algeria. However, the forest was destroyed during the Algerian War in the same year, further exacerbating the challenges faced by these noble creatures.

Today, approximately 100 captive lions possess the genes of the Barbary lions, but none of them are pure descendants. While these lions carry a part of their ancestral legacy, the extinction of the Barbary lions in the wild serves as a stark reminder of the consequences of human actions on the delicate balance of nature. The story of the Barbary lion stands as a poignant testament to the importance of conservation efforts to protect and preserve the incredible diversity of life on our planet.

## Iberian Lynx

The Iberian Lynx is a spellbinding feline that graces the Iberian Peninsula with its elusive presence. With tufted ears, sleek fur, and piercing eyes, it epitomizes the enigmatic allure of the wilderness. Known as "Lynx pardinus," this species is the world's most endangered feline, making every glimpse a rare and cherished moment.

Historically, the Iberian Lynx roamed expansively across Spain and Portugal. Steeped in cultural significance, it has appeared in numerous myths and legends. A revered animal in local folklore, its mysterious aura has fueled countless tales, solidifying its status as a creature of great importance and intrigue.

While stunning in appearance, it's the behavior of the Iberian Lynx that truly sets it apart. Highly solitary and territorial, it is a master of stealth and ambush. These lynxes have an almost magical ability to blend seamlessly into their surroundings, making them experts at evading detection. Fun fact: they can sprint at speeds of up to 50 miles per hour for short distances.

The Iberian Lynx is not just a symbol of beauty and folklore but also a keystone species in its ecosystem. By controlling populations of rabbits and other small mammals, it plays a vital role in maintaining the ecological balance of its native habitats.

However, the Iberian Lynx has also faced significant threats. Habitat fragmentation, road accidents, and a decline in prey have all contributed to its dwindling numbers. At one point, fewer than 100 individuals were estimated to exist in the wild. Concerted conservation efforts have since improved these figures, but the lynx's future remains precarious.

In a world where biodiversity is increasingly under threat, the story of the Iberian Lynx stands as both a cautionary tale and a symbol of hope. It reminds us of the urgent need for sustained conservation efforts to preserve not just this magnificent creature but the intricate web of life it represents.
