## Strategies

### Sandwiching

1. Incoming buy, deliver bundle {mybuy, buy, mysell}
2. Incoming sell (requires inventory), deliver bundle {mysell, sell, mybuy} (JaredFromSubway's claim to fame and riches)

### JIT Liquidity

Incoming transaction, frontrun it with a large liquidity position at the optimal tick (simulate slippage price)
