## Overview

Original paper(s) is(are) released twice, the first time (suspected to rush to beat the second) with only 3 authors, making the team eligible for a noble prize.

- [The First Room-Temperature Ambient-Pressure Superconductor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12008)

People rush to replicate the study/results.

- [First-principles study on the electronic structure of $Pb_{10âˆ’x}Cu_x(PO_4)_6O (x=0, 1)$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16040)
- [Synthesis of possible room temperature superconductor $LK-99:Pb_9Cu(PO_4)_6O$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16402)

A theoretical explanation for LK-99 is [released](https://twitter.com/sineatrix/status/1686182852667572224) on July 31, 2023, by [Sinead Griffin](https://twitter.com/sineatrix) out of Berkeley.

- [Origin of correlated isolated flat bands in copper-substituted lead phosphate apatite.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.16892.pdf)

[Douglas Natelson](https://www.blogger.com/profile/13340091255404229559) published a [blog post](http://nanoscale.blogspot.com/2023/07/condensed-matter-on-public-stage-and.html) expressing a pessemistic view on the whole debacle.

## TLDR on the drama as of August 1, 2023

Since 1999, a tiny group of Korean scientists, working in obscurity and in their off-time, pursue the dying wishes of their materials professor who has his own theory about room temperature and pressure superconductors, a century-defining material, the holy grail of materials science and an instant Nobel prize.

A week ago, one of them went rogue and published a paper describing how to produce their substance, LK-99, which may or not be this holy grail material. It requires no exotic materials or equipment to reproduce, but the paper omits a lot of detail about the specifics of the synthesis.

They accompany it with pictures and a video. There are mistakes in the paper, but they authors say they are trivial, will be fixed, and all of them stand by their claims, even as they feud with each other.

This kicks off a world-wide race to deboonk or reproduce. US, Chinese, Japanese, and Indian labs all drop what they're doing and give LK-99 a shot. One guy at a startup in California tries on his own as well, and 10,000 people tune in to watch a Twitch stream of a webcam pointed at a kiln. The process takes a few days.

A Russian anime catgirl joins the fracas, ruthlessly making fun of both the original Korean scientists for their bizarre methodology, and of Western/Chinese labs for simply following the steps without understanding what they do. She applies the Soviet technique of ignoring the steps outlined and instead trying to figure out what they actually do, and comes up with her own procedure using shit just laying around her apartment.

She produces a small grain of the floaty rock, takes a picture but refuses to take a video, and mercilessly ridicules everybody who keeps asking her for more proofs because it was so easy to do, they should just be doing it themselves if they weren't mediocre westoids. She's catty and great.
