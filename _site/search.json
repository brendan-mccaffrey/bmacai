The price of mango reached $0.91 (a 24x increase).\nAt this new inflated price, account B was in the money for ~ $423 million. He used this account value to take out a loan of $116 million consisting of several tokens.\nAfter the attack, the MNGO/USD spot market then traded down to $0.02, which put account A in the money. However, Mango protocol was effectively drained of all liquidity, so account A could not be paid out."

Thus, tokens with low liquidity could be easily manipulated such that the protocol believes “fair price” is multiples above what anyone would purchase the token at in free markets."

(Decline)\nLate 1940s, there was a new optimizing with the invention of a relatavistic perturbation theory, where the infinities could be absorbed into a redefinition of parameters like mass and charge of the electron. People thought this was sweeping problems under the rug, but it also may have been a way of selecting good theories (renormalizable theories).\nFor example, theere’s nothing in the symmetries of quantum electrodynamics which rules out putting a term in the field equations (or Lagrangian), which could make the magnetic moment of the electron anything you want. This would make the mass of the electron -1, which means the theory is not renormalizable, and thus shows invalid.\nLate 1960s and early 70s, the standard model came to fruition - this was the renaissance of Quantum Field theory. But there were still doubts whether this was a fundamental theory or an effective one.\nQuantum Field Theory & Einsteinian Physics may be low energy approximations of a more fundamental theory."

    "text": "Notes\n\nAll-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO): The AARO is the Pentagon’s UFO office. It is currently unable to confirm or deny whether it has discovered any verifiable information to substantiate claims that any current or former U.S. programs have had possession or reverse-engineered materials from non-human intelligences or unknown origin.\nDepartment of Defense (DoD) Stance: The DoD spokesperson, Susan Gough, stated that the AARO has not discovered any verifiable information to substantiate such claims. However, she declined to comment further on whether the term “extraterrestrial” could extend to materials of unknown origin or non-human intelligences.\nAccess to Information: Gough confirmed that the AARO has not been denied access to any U.S. government program, past or present, during the course of its work. She also stated that the AARO may receive all UAP-related information, including any classified national security information involving military, intelligence, and intelligence-related activities, at all levels of classification regardless of any restrictive access controls, special access programs, or compartmented access programs.\nTitle 50 Authorities: Gough addressed the issue of Title 50 authorities, stating that such authorities are unrelated to the AARO’s ability to receive all UAP-related information through authorized disclosures.\nPublic Affairs Policies: Gough explained that it is DoD policy that all interactions with the news media at the Department level, including press queries, are coordinated with the Office of the Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs. She also noted that her portfolio includes UAP, AARO, and the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence & Security, as well as other issues and offices.\nWhistleblower Trust: The blog post mentions that the AARO, which currently reports to the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence & Security, is not trusted by numerous whistleblowers. The issue may stem from the AARO’s proximity to the OUSDI&S, which has previously been criticized for allegedly persecuting whistleblowers.\nConclusion: The blog post concludes by noting that the National Defense Authorization Act of 2023 means that the AARO should report directly to Deputy Secretary of Defense, Kathleen Hicks, and the Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence on all operational and security matters relating to the AARO. However, there is no indication that this has been implemented yet."

    "text": "mRNA Vaccine x Myocarditis/Pericarditis\n\nDifferent virus vs vax myocarditis mechanisms isn’t just theory. Here’s why you’re correct in real life.\n\nTIMING\n\nVirus myocarditis As Offit said, SARS2 viral myocarditis most often manifests as post-viral myocarditis due to molecular mimicry.\n\nThis means a few to several weeks after covid infection (ie symptoms/viral load were already gone weeks or 1-2 months ago), there is Ab/T crossreactivity (mimicry) to self-antigens in heart cells.\nThis mechanism is most often mild, good prognosis.\nTo clarify, SARS2 viral fulminant myocarditis, which can occur in days to a week after covid infection, is very rare. Initial covid presentation with fulminant myocarditis is so rare and unusual, it’s a case report. Almost all SARS2 viral myocarditis is post-viral and mild.\n\nVax myocarditis Most often occurs days to 1 week after 2nd vax dose. Also occurs after 1st vax dose or booster.\n\nThis timing is atypical of mimicry. Rather, this timing is textbook for a primary or secondary direct immune cell attack on mRNA-transfected heart cells.\nOffit knows all this. He’s obviously pulling a “limited hangout”. Pfizer will copy what Offit says.\nIf politicians were honest, they’d ask if mechanisms are the same (mimicry) for both virus and vax myo, then why are the timing and severity distinctly different for virus vs vax myo?\n\n\nSERUM VAX SPIKE\nThere’s a high correlation of vax spike found in serum (blood) of vax myocarditis. Vax controls showed no serum vax spike.\nImportantly, Ab/T immunoprofiling of vax myocarditis patients were indistinguishable from vax controls (ie no unusual autoantibodies or autoreactive T cells (no mimicry signs)).\nThis is more evidence that in vax myo, your immune cells are killing your own heart cells that look virus-infected.\nThere’s more vax myo mechanisms like inflammasome or apoptosis. But you said the main vax myo mechanism perfectly.”\nCirculating Spike Protein Detected in Post–COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine Myocarditis"

So then they had a pandemic, the emergency allowed them to do it. This technology, in my opinion, was at least 3 decades out from being usefully and safely deployed at all, if at all.

    "section": "Summary",
    "text": "Summary\nMagnetohydrodynamics (MHD), also known as hydromagnetics, is a field in physics that studies the dynamics of electrically conducting fluids, particularly the interaction between magnetic fields and such fluids. These fluids could be plasma, liquid metals, or even seawater. MHD is a synthesis of fluid dynamics and electromagnetism.\nThe governing equations of MHD are the Navier-Stokes equations (in the limit of high Reynolds number) coupled with Maxwell’s equations. In the ideal MHD approximation, effects such as resistivity and viscosity are neglected, leading to a relatively simple set of governing equations:\n\nContinuity Equation: This equation ensures the conservation of mass.\n∂ρ/∂t + ∇·(ρv) = 0\nMomentum Equation: Combines Newton’s second law and the Lorentz force, accounting for the forces due to pressure gradients, gravity, and electromagnetic fields. In the absence of viscosity, this simplifies to:\nρ(∂v/∂t + v·∇v) = -∇p + ρg + (J×B)\nInduction Equation: Describes how the magnetic field evolves over time, given the fluid’s velocity and existing magnetic field.\n∂B/∂t = ∇×(v×B)\nEnergy Equation: This equation describes the conservation of energy, which is usually taken in the form of the first law of thermodynamics.\nAmpère’s Law with Maxwell’s Addition:\n∇×B = μ0J\nJ is the current density vector, B is the magnetic field, and μ0 is the magnetic permeability.\n\nIn these equations, ρ represents fluid density, v fluid velocity, p pressure, g gravitational acceleration, J current density, and B magnetic field.\nMHD has a wide range of applications, from studying astrophysical phenomena such as solar flares and accretion disks, to engineering applications like nuclear fusion research, liquid metal cooling in reactors, and even potential propulsion systems.\nHowever, real-world situations often involve non-ideal MHD where effects such as resistivity cannot be ignored. Understanding these effects often requires incorporating the full set of Maxwell’s equations and solving them alongside the fluid dynamics equations, which makes for a much more complex computational problem. In some non-ideal MHD scenarios, magnetic reconnection, turbulence, and other instabilities can occur, which are active research areas in this field."

    "text": "Project White Hot\nPROJECT ‘WHITE HOT’ Mission Assessment of Recovered Lenticular Aerodyne Objects\nGeneral Nathan Twining Briefing document for President Eisenhower\nPART 1. PROJECT WHITE HOT INTELLIGENCE ESTIMATE (PRELIMINARY)\nLANDING ZONE NO, 1 Socorro, New Mexico–the unidentified lenticular-shaped Aerodyne which has been designated ULAT-1, has been evaluated as a non air breathing aircraft of unknown origin. Totally lacking conventional wing, fuselage, nacelle, control, and fuel systems strongly indicates it is not Russian.\nConsultation with Paperclip specialists concur. Aerodynamic features exhibited in ULAT-1 represents a very high degree of engineering and sophistication not seen in this country.\nDimensional homogeneity study cannot explain how this craft sustains load and lift factors necessary for flight.\nThe power plant does not even remotely resemble any conventional type now in use. Lacking any discernible intake or exhaust features, it is the opinion of AMC and ONR that this craft was designed to operate outside of the earth’s atmosphere.\nThe unconventional conclusions reached by members of this fact finding mission remain tentative at this time. Some members have expressed the view that ULAT-1 may be the product of an advanced culture from another planet that is much older than ours and has utilized their science and intellect for interplanetary space travel. It is not precisely known if the occupants purposely had the objective of exploration and of curiosity or with the intent of surveying for other reasons. So far, no hostile action or intent has been observed since they made their presence known.\nGiven the fact that our atomic bomb tests, atmospheric exploration with rockets, and XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXed in New Mexico, could have precipitated the events that led to the incident and subsequent actions taken by the military.\nOperating under the assumption that the fallen object was a long-range Russian reconnaissance platform collecting aerial photographic intelligence data military intelligence personnel were a instructed to secure the craft, debris and any occupants as rapidly as possible.\nConcerns over possible exposure to civilian of unknown biological and chemical agents dictated the quarantine measures taken.\nRadiation hazards were assumed and protective measures were taken as well.\nIn the interest or National Security priorities it was necessary to detain civilian witnesses for interrogation to satisfy intelligence requirements and quash rumors that could alert potential espionage agents known to be in the vicinity.\nSeveral bodies were discovered.\nBecause on-site medical personnel were unsure of the physiological make up of the occupants, special preparations and preservation methods were employed. Autopsy information obtained so far suggests that the occupants mimic the features associated with Orientals.\nOutwardly, they appear human-like with but one exception, autopsy notes mention a rarely observed XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXs present which supports the premise that these beings originate from another planet.\nPART TWO TECHNICAL EVALUATION (PRELIMINARY) ULAT-1\nUpon close examination of the exterior surfaces of the craft’s fuselage, metallurgists found the the skin to be of a ferrous metal white in color. The metal exhibits all the characteristics of high grade steel. It was determined that the steel was cold-formed and heat created.\n\nTensile strength was estimated in excess of 50,000 pounds per square inch. Shear tests give the metal a durability rating above 175,000 pounds per square inch, making this fuselage extremely strong and heat resistant.\nStatic and pressure flow simulations were impressive. The low profile ration of 6-1 gives the aerodyne a great advantage in overcoming the restrictions of the boundary layer effect in high performance operations.\nSpan flanges are constructed in unusual kinematic design which is believed to allow strain relief at supersonic speeds. There were no visible signs of plate-stiffeners, there were no fasteners, weld, rivets, or fittings, holding the fuselage together.\nLack of wings, flaps, stabilizers, and surface central features, suggests that the craft is a lifting body.\nThere are no air intakes for exhaust.\nThere are no cables\nThere are no identifiable electronics (wiring, ignition, lights, instrument, compartment, engine, motors, vacuum tubes, solenoids, generators, heaters, etc.)\nThe power-plant, (severely damaged) XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXx neutronic engine. XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXx detected heavy water and deuterium (light hydrogen) elements appeared to be the primary ignitor. A series of coils and heavy magnets connected to the neutronic engine via an oddly arranged group of electrodes (actually not yet identified) appears to be the active force. One small motor was examined. It is encased in a pure aluminium capsule directly underneath the main compartment. There is a small exhaust aperture attached that was what can only be described as an helicoid mechanism XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX. The auxiliary motor may be articulated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNavigation and engine controls may be activated by tactile manipulation. Viewing may have been achieved by form of television imagery. Symbolic notation appears to be the form of flight and control indicators. Flat panels of unknown metal has been suggested as a device associated with the operation of the aerodyne was discovered and analyzed. It’s mode of operation and purpose is unknown.\nThe absence of provisions, berthing compartments and storage areas, suggest the notion that this craft may be a short range reconnaissance platform. The only recognizable features XXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\nMode of operation of operation is believed to be instrumentation and suggests that the aerodyne from reconstruction from available wreckage XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX biosensory and optical stimuli for these reasons:\n\nabsence of indicator signals Absence of any circular dials Absence of linear dials or moving pointers Absence of counters Absence of scopes No mechanical signal indicators 12. There were identifiable control types found among the assortment of artefacts that would indicate the operation of the propulsion unit was manually activated – no knobs, push buttons, toggle switches, levers, balls, handwheels, hand-cranks, or foot pedals were observed in the interior space of the flight cabin.\n\nThe apparent lack of additional clothing and equipment reinforces the belief that the occupants were engaged in a purely exploratory flight.\nIt is not presently known if electromagnetic radiation effects from the power plant had contributed to pilot error or death before impact. If inadequate shielding was the primary cause of pilot error XXXXXXXXXXXXXXs detected.\nIt is believed by some of the crash inspection personnel that sudden decompression and change in atmospheric pressure may have contributed to pilot error. Clothing removed from occupants do not resemble any pressure suit currently being tested by the Army or the Navy for high altitude experiments. Since temperature and humidity factors for the occupants is unknown, it is impossible to determine if decompression and temperature changed affected circulatory and dexterity functions. Although it is believed the occupants may have been overcome by some yet undiscovered pollutant or noxious fumes originating inside the craft.\nRotation or rapid oscillation could have been a contributing factor in pilot error. It is not known if organic effects played a part either since medical data is non-existent in which to make any judgment as to exact cause of death or machine failure.\nThe most probable cause of the crash is believed to be excessive acceleration combined with steep descent. The seating arrangement was transversely designed about the vertical axis of the occupants in a positive direction of flight. The panels removed from the craft resemble the ones taken from the occupants, suggesting a symbionic relationship between operator and the function of the aerodyne’s operation. A very tentative working theory was expressed by the scientific members of the inspection team that pilot-aerodyne interaction may occur via electronic-nonword symbols perceived through the tactile manipulation of the fingers feeding impulses to the brain and visa versa. All of which may suggest a non-inert quality or the materials existent as being a product or artificial intelligence.\nThe following elements were analyzed and found to exist in the small neutronic power plant that was found inside ULAT-l:\n\n\nUF6 in metallic form;\nhydrogen-fluoride gas;\nwater and uranium tetra fluoride;\npowdered magnesium and potassium chlorate,\nmetal similar to lead with a chocolate brown color;\nU-235 in metallic form;\nplastic-like material similar to NE 102,\nBeryllium,\nPure aluminium;\nThorium isotope material;\nPlutonium powder.\n\n\nScientists from Los Alamos and Sandia Base were alarmed that the power plant could possibly function as a bomb if the elements described above were processed in similar fashion as was done for the lens and shot-gun detonators. This originally was the first conclusion. After further evaluation, it was determined that since no recognizable firing circuits were identified, the threat or detonation did not exist.\nThe only evidence or circuitry found on the motor was thin plastic-like sheets fashioned like platters embossed on the exterior of the spherically-shaped casing coated by a thin film or pure silver. Under high power magnification it was observed a series of fine grid-like lines intersecting groups of dots arranged in circular patterns.\n\nPART III SCIENTIFIC PROBABILITIES\n\nBased on all available evidence collected from recovered exhibits currently under study by AHC, AFSWP, NEPA, AEC, ONA, NACA, JBDB, RAND, USAAF SAG. and MIT, are deemed extraterrestrial in nature. This conclusion was reached as a result of comparisons of artifacts XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX discovery in 1941. The technology is outside the scope of US science, even that of German rocket and aircraft development.\nInterplanetary space travel is possible provided adequate funding, necessary resources are made available, and national interest is piqued.\nOur solar system is not unique. Chances are favorable for intelligent life on other planets notwithstanding similar development not unlike our own.\nBeing that our culture is relatively young (in relation to the cosmic scale), it is possible that other cultures may have developed faster, or are much older and have avoided the pitfalls common in our historical and scientific development.\nHuman origins may not be constrained to one planet. Our genus may be found among solar systems similar to our own.\nThe laws of physics and genetics may have a genesis in a higher, structured order than once previously thought.\n\nPART IV POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS\nGiven the existing political climate in the US and the unstable conditions in Europe, it is the considered opinion of the members, that if the Administration went public with the information as found in this report now, the results would be damaging, even fatal to the world Political structure as it now exists. The following considerations were reviewed and debated, which led the mission to the following opinions:\n\nPublic trust of the political institutions may be eroded and possibly be held in disrepute.\nA complete revisioning make take place as institutions of higher learning thus calling into question the certainty of scientific knowledge.\nThe ability of the Armed Forces to secure National Security would be put in jeopardy and possibly lead to undue public fear and disorder.\nHistory and religion in the political context would probably suffer the most damage causing unprecedented upheaval in social and psychological well-being.\nPolitical repercussions may occur in our diplomatic efforts of containing the Communist threat to our democratic interests.\nIf such an announcement were made by the current Administration, it could be perceived by opposing party as a trick, laying open to accusations of unethetical (sic) posturing and manipulation of the public’s mind.\n\nPART V NATIONAL SECURITY STRUCTURE\nWith the passage of the National Security Act of 1947 XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXas presented an unprecedented situation regarding maintaining secrecy related to the information contained in this report.\nIn the early months of 1942, up until the present, intrusions of unidentified aircraft have occasionally been documented, but there has been no serious investigations by the intelligence arm of the Government. Even the recovery case of 1941 did not create a unified intelligence effort to exploit possible technological gains with the exception of the Manhattan Project. We now have an opportunity to extend our technology beyond the threshold that we have achieved, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX. Aside from technological gains, we face an even greater challenge, that of learning the intent of such a presence. There are questions that remain unanswered, such as: What forces face us? What kind of defense do we have? Where do they come from and what kind of weapons do they possess? Where can we stage our forces in advance, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX How wide a front? How many craft can we expect? And XXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\nThe members of the mission are prepared to submit a separate report on just this problem alone. And it would take a dozen volumes to explain how these problems should be met.\nOur only point, however, is that a combined intelligence and research operation would be a vast, intricate, covertly planned marshaling of resources, human and material, to solve a specific, clearly defined problem.\nWe have to find effective methods of persuasion with other government agencies without creating a sense of impending doom. The first task is to carefully appraise the problem. The second is to evaluate the known resources and probable strategy of the visitors. The third is to inventory our own ways and means, ascertain how much resources we can bring to bear, and how fast. The third is to devise our strategic plan. And last is to work out with infinite pains the tactical details and the myriad secondary problems of funding and security.\nIt is the unanimous opinion of the members that Operation MAJESTIC TWELVE be a fully funded ant operational TOP SECRET Research and Development intelligence gathering agency. It is also recommended that a panel of experts be appointed to chair and oversee the functions and operations of said agency. It’s members should have appropriate security clearances and full cooperation XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXX the National Security Council, the Pentagon, XXXXXXXht, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX Joint Intelligence Committee, Joint Intelligence Objectives Agency, Central Intelligence Agency, Atomic Energy Commission, Joint Research and Development Board, Army Security Agency, and the National Advisory Board on Aeronautics.\nXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXgy are highlighted:\n\nPropeller driven bomber aircraft and jet engines, armed with conventional and atomic bombs.\nJet fighter aircraft, including some of super­sonic speed, armed with rockets and guns.\nPropeller-driven aircraft, valued for their endurance. .\nGuided anti-aircraft missiles, and radar-guided anti-aircraft guns.\nShort and medium-range guided missiles. Drone aircraft.\nAtomic charges, in bombs, missiles and torpedoes.\n\nIn the arena of nuclear weapons we feel there is a certain advantage to be gained XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX. It is speculated by some that if reduced size and miniature circuitry were introduced into the proposed hydrogen bomb program, it would give US Strategic Air Forces a great deterrence capability over the Russians. Current studies at MIT of micro-electronics taken from ULAT-1 may give us the strategic advantage so desired. It is strongly recommended that funding be allocated in this area.\nThere is a good chance that the Russians may try to make use of the flying saucer scare by public news media and diplomatic means of a technological breakthrough in aircraft and missile development. We feel that such a disclosure would certainly cause great embarrassment to our elected officials and to the military, not to mention the panic felt by the citizenry. To counter such a threat, it is recommended that a counterintelligence program be drawn up and held in abeyance if at such time the situation should present itself. It might be suggested that we should make a preempted use of these objects for the purpose of psychological warfare once the true nature of these objects are known and understood.\nTo further assist and aid all MAJCOM in the US and overseas, it is recommended that a standard intelligence reporting system be implemented through standard reporting channels with technical data forwarding instructions. At present, there are no specific intelligence guidelines available to military commanders in dealing with sightings and material evidence collection. It would be advisable for the respective Secretaries of the Armed Forces to devise a security policy of plausible denial, if and when the public becomes aware of the reality of these objects and the interest of the military of such incidents.\nIn conclusion, for reasons of national security and the public well being, the US must be perceived as being the top of the heap and every effort must be made to insure that there is, and never has been, a threat to the country."

In 1948, there was a reported sighting in Morocco, and in 1958, another sighting was claimed in a heavily forested area near the city of Sétif in Algeria. However, the forest was destroyed during the Algerian War in the same year, further exacerbating the challenges faced by these noble creatures.\nToday, approximately 100 captive lions possess the genes of the Barbary lions, but none of them are pure descendants. While these lions carry a part of their ancestral legacy, the extinction of the Barbary lions in the wild serves as a stark reminder of the consequences of human actions on the delicate balance of nature. The story of the Barbary lion stands as a poignant testament to the importance of conservation efforts to protect and preserve the incredible diversity of life on our planet.\n\ntweet\ndiscovery article"

(Decline)\nLate 1940s, there was a new optimizing with the invention of a relatavistic perturbation theory, where the infinities could be absorbed into a redefinition of parameters like mass and charge of the electron. People thought this was sweeping problems under the rug, but it also may have been a way of selecting good theories (renormalizable theories).\nFor example, theere’s nothing in the symmetries of quantum electrodynamics which rules out putting a term in the field equations (or Lagrangian), which could make the magnetic moment of the electron anything you want. This would make the mass of the electron -1, which means the theory is not renormalizable, and thus shows invalid.\nLate 1960s and early 70s, the standard model came to fruition - this was the renaissance of Quantum Field theory. But there were still doubts whether this was a fundamental theory or an effective one.\nQuantum Field Theory & Einsteinian Physics may be low energy approximations of a more fundamental theory."

    "section": "Summary",
    "text": "Summary\nMagnetohydrodynamics (MHD), also known as hydromagnetics, is a field in physics that studies the dynamics of electrically conducting fluids, particularly the interaction between magnetic fields and such fluids. These fluids could be plasma, liquid metals, or even seawater. MHD is a synthesis of fluid dynamics and electromagnetism.\nThe governing equations of MHD are the Navier-Stokes equations (in the limit of high Reynolds number) coupled with Maxwell’s equations. In the ideal MHD approximation, effects such as resistivity and viscosity are neglected, leading to a relatively simple set of governing equations:\n\nContinuity Equation: This equation ensures the conservation of mass.\n∂ρ/∂t + ∇·(ρv) = 0\nMomentum Equation: Combines Newton’s second law and the Lorentz force, accounting for the forces due to pressure gradients, gravity, and electromagnetic fields. In the absence of viscosity, this simplifies to:\nρ(∂v/∂t + v·∇v) = -∇p + ρg + (J×B)\nInduction Equation: Describes how the magnetic field evolves over time, given the fluid’s velocity and existing magnetic field.\n∂B/∂t = ∇×(v×B)\nEnergy Equation: This equation describes the conservation of energy, which is usually taken in the form of the first law of thermodynamics.\nAmpère’s Law with Maxwell’s Addition:\n∇×B = μ0J\nJ is the current density vector, B is the magnetic field, and μ0 is the magnetic permeability.\n\nIn these equations, ρ represents fluid density, v fluid velocity, p pressure, g gravitational acceleration, J current density, and B magnetic field.\nMHD has a wide range of applications, from studying astrophysical phenomena such as solar flares and accretion disks, to engineering applications like nuclear fusion research, liquid metal cooling in reactors, and even potential propulsion systems.\nHowever, real-world situations often involve non-ideal MHD where effects such as resistivity cannot be ignored. Understanding these effects often requires incorporating the full set of Maxwell’s equations and solving them alongside the fluid dynamics equations, which makes for a much more complex computational problem. In some non-ideal MHD scenarios, magnetic reconnection, turbulence, and other instabilities can occur, which are active research areas in this field."

The Department of Defense (DoD) spokesperson, Susan Gough, stated that the AARO has not discovered any verifiable information to substantiate such claims.

    "text": "Notes\n\nAll-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO): The AARO is the Pentagon’s UFO office. It is currently unable to confirm or deny whether it has discovered any verifiable information to substantiate claims that any current or former U.S. programs have had possession or reverse-engineered materials from non-human intelligences or unknown origin.\nDepartment of Defense (DoD) Stance: The DoD spokesperson, Susan Gough, stated that the AARO has not discovered any verifiable information to substantiate such claims. However, she declined to comment further on whether the term “extraterrestrial” could extend to materials of unknown origin or non-human intelligences.\nAccess to Information: Gough confirmed that the AARO has not been denied access to any U.S. government program, past or present, during the course of its work. She also stated that the AARO may receive all UAP-related information, including any classified national security information involving military, intelligence, and intelligence-related activities, at all levels of classification regardless of any restrictive access controls, special access programs, or compartmented access programs.\nTitle 50 Authorities: Gough addressed the issue of Title 50 authorities, stating that such authorities are unrelated to the AARO’s ability to receive all UAP-related information through authorized disclosures.\nPublic Affairs Policies: Gough explained that it is DoD policy that all interactions with the news media at the Department level, including press queries, are coordinated with the Office of the Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs. She also noted that her portfolio includes UAP, AARO, and the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence & Security, as well as other issues and offices.\nWhistleblower Trust: The blog post mentions that the AARO, which currently reports to the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence & Security, is not trusted by numerous whistleblowers. The issue may stem from the AARO’s proximity to the OUSDI&S, which has previously been criticized for allegedly persecuting whistleblowers.\nConclusion: The blog post concludes by noting that the National Defense Authorization Act of 2023 means that the AARO should report directly to Deputy Secretary of Defense, Kathleen Hicks, and the Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence on all operational and security matters relating to the AARO. However, there is no indication that this has been implemented yet."

UNIDIR says he was selected through a “competitive and transparent recruitment process…on the basis of his qualifications, skills and experience for the position.”\nTribune de Geneve: “The presence of Zakharov’s son in Geneva implies that Switzerland issued him with a visa, which is compulsory for Russian nationals wishing to enter and stay in the country. When questioned, the Swiss State Secretariat for Migration would not comment on the case. Alexander Zakharov’s son did not respond to our messages.”\n\ntweet\narticle"

    "text": "mRNA Vaccine x Myocarditis/Pericarditis\n\nDifferent virus vs vax myocarditis mechanisms isn’t just theory. Here’s why you’re correct in real life.\n\nTIMING\n\nVirus myocarditis As Offit said, SARS2 viral myocarditis most often manifests as post-viral myocarditis due to molecular mimicry.\n\nThis means a few to several weeks after covid infection (ie symptoms/viral load were already gone weeks or 1-2 months ago), there is Ab/T crossreactivity (mimicry) to self-antigens in heart cells.\nThis mechanism is most often mild, good prognosis.\nTo clarify, SARS2 viral fulminant myocarditis, which can occur in days to a week after covid infection, is very rare. Initial covid presentation with fulminant myocarditis is so rare and unusual, it’s a case report. Almost all SARS2 viral myocarditis is post-viral and mild.\n\nVax myocarditis Most often occurs days to 1 week after 2nd vax dose. Also occurs after 1st vax dose or booster.\n\nThis timing is atypical of mimicry. Rather, this timing is textbook for a primary or secondary direct immune cell attack on mRNA-transfected heart cells.\nOffit knows all this. He’s obviously pulling a “limited hangout”. Pfizer will copy what Offit says.\nIf politicians were honest, they’d ask if mechanisms are the same (mimicry) for both virus and vax myo, then why are the timing and severity distinctly different for virus vs vax myo?\n\n\nSERUM VAX SPIKE\nThere’s a high correlation of vax spike found in serum (blood) of vax myocarditis. Vax controls showed no serum vax spike.\nImportantly, Ab/T immunoprofiling of vax myocarditis patients were indistinguishable from vax controls (ie no unusual autoantibodies or autoreactive T cells (no mimicry signs)).\nThis is more evidence that in vax myo, your immune cells are killing your own heart cells that look virus-infected.\nThere’s more vax myo mechanisms like inflammasome or apoptosis. But you said the main vax myo mechanism perfectly.”\nCirculating Spike Protein Detected in Post–COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine Myocarditis"

But it has a giant gaping flaw in it, which is; Any cell of yours that produces a foreign protein, will be targetted by your immune system and destroyed. You will create an autoimmune disorder. When it works. How do you keep it out of your heart. Not by coding it in a lipid nanoparticle. So, they had no way to deliver it safely to market. So then they had a pandemic, the emergency allowed them to do it. This technology, in my opinion, was at least 3 decades out from being usefully and safely deployed at all, if at all. They did not want to wait, this crisis gave them the opportunity not to wait. And now, they will blame the spike protein, we picked the wrong protein. When in actual fact there are 2 problems, the spike protein and the platform itself."

Survivors of that turbulent period claimed that “the waters of the Tigris ran black with ink from the enormous quantities of books flung into the river and red from the blood of the scientists and philosophers killed.” Amidst the turmoil in the region and as empires crumbled and fell, the Barbary lions managed to persist until the arrival of European colonists in the 19th century.\nDuring this time, big-game hunting gained popularity, and it proved to be devastating for the already dwindling lion population.

    "text": "Project White Hot\nPROJECT ‘WHITE HOT’ Mission Assessment of Recovered Lenticular Aerodyne Objects\nGeneral Nathan Twining Briefing document for President Eisenhower\nPART 1. PROJECT WHITE HOT INTELLIGENCE ESTIMATE (PRELIMINARY)\nLANDING ZONE NO, 1 Socorro, New Mexico–the unidentified lenticular-shaped Aerodyne which has been designated ULAT-1, has been evaluated as a non air breathing aircraft of unknown origin. Totally lacking conventional wing, fuselage, nacelle, control, and fuel systems strongly indicates it is not Russian.\nConsultation with Paperclip specialists concur. Aerodynamic features exhibited in ULAT-1 represents a very high degree of engineering and sophistication not seen in this country.\nDimensional homogeneity study cannot explain how this craft sustains load and lift factors necessary for flight.\nThe power plant does not even remotely resemble any conventional type now in use. Lacking any discernible intake or exhaust features, it is the opinion of AMC and ONR that this craft was designed to operate outside of the earth’s atmosphere.\nThe unconventional conclusions reached by members of this fact finding mission remain tentative at this time. Some members have expressed the view that ULAT-1 may be the product of an advanced culture from another planet that is much older than ours and has utilized their science and intellect for interplanetary space travel. It is not precisely known if the occupants purposely had the objective of exploration and of curiosity or with the intent of surveying for other reasons. So far, no hostile action or intent has been observed since they made their presence known.\nGiven the fact that our atomic bomb tests, atmospheric exploration with rockets, and XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXed in New Mexico, could have precipitated the events that led to the incident and subsequent actions taken by the military.\nOperating under the assumption that the fallen object was a long-range Russian reconnaissance platform collecting aerial photographic intelligence data military intelligence personnel were a instructed to secure the craft, debris and any occupants as rapidly as possible.\nConcerns over possible exposure to civilian of unknown biological and chemical agents dictated the quarantine measures taken.\nRadiation hazards were assumed and protective measures were taken as well.\nIn the interest or National Security priorities it was necessary to detain civilian witnesses for interrogation to satisfy intelligence requirements and quash rumors that could alert potential espionage agents known to be in the vicinity.\nSeveral bodies were discovered.\nBecause on-site medical personnel were unsure of the physiological make up of the occupants, special preparations and preservation methods were employed. Autopsy information obtained so far suggests that the occupants mimic the features associated with Orientals.\nOutwardly, they appear human-like with but one exception, autopsy notes mention a rarely observed XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXs present which supports the premise that these beings originate from another planet.\nPART TWO TECHNICAL EVALUATION (PRELIMINARY) ULAT-1\nUpon close examination of the exterior surfaces of the craft’s fuselage, metallurgists found the the skin to be of a ferrous metal white in color. The metal exhibits all the characteristics of high grade steel. It was determined that the steel was cold-formed and heat created.\n\nTensile strength was estimated in excess of 50,000 pounds per square inch. Shear tests give the metal a durability rating above 175,000 pounds per square inch, making this fuselage extremely strong and heat resistant.\nStatic and pressure flow simulations were impressive. The low profile ration of 6-1 gives the aerodyne a great advantage in overcoming the restrictions of the boundary layer effect in high performance operations.\nSpan flanges are constructed in unusual kinematic design which is believed to allow strain relief at supersonic speeds. There were no visible signs of plate-stiffeners, there were no fasteners, weld, rivets, or fittings, holding the fuselage together.\nLack of wings, flaps, stabilizers, and surface central features, suggests that the craft is a lifting body.\nThere are no air intakes for exhaust.\nThere are no cables\nThere are no identifiable electronics (wiring, ignition, lights, instrument, compartment, engine, motors, vacuum tubes, solenoids, generators, heaters, etc.)\nThe power-plant, (severely damaged) XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXx neutronic engine. XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXx detected heavy water and deuterium (light hydrogen) elements appeared to be the primary ignitor. A series of coils and heavy magnets connected to the neutronic engine via an oddly arranged group of electrodes (actually not yet identified) appears to be the active force. One small motor was examined. It is encased in a pure aluminium capsule directly underneath the main compartment. There is a small exhaust aperture attached that was what can only be described as an helicoid mechanism XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX. The auxiliary motor may be articulated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNavigation and engine controls may be activated by tactile manipulation. Viewing may have been achieved by form of television imagery. Symbolic notation appears to be the form of flight and control indicators. Flat panels of unknown metal has been suggested as a device associated with the operation of the aerodyne was discovered and analyzed. It’s mode of operation and purpose is unknown.\nThe absence of provisions, berthing compartments and storage areas, suggest the notion that this craft may be a short range reconnaissance platform. The only recognizable features XXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\nMode of operation of operation is believed to be instrumentation and suggests that the aerodyne from reconstruction from available wreckage XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX biosensory and optical stimuli for these reasons:\n\nabsence of indicator signals Absence of any circular dials Absence of linear dials or moving pointers Absence of counters Absence of scopes No mechanical signal indicators 12. There were identifiable control types found among the assortment of artefacts that would indicate the operation of the propulsion unit was manually activated – no knobs, push buttons, toggle switches, levers, balls, handwheels, hand-cranks, or foot pedals were observed in the interior space of the flight cabin.\n\nThe apparent lack of additional clothing and equipment reinforces the belief that the occupants were engaged in a purely exploratory flight.\nIt is not presently known if electromagnetic radiation effects from the power plant had contributed to pilot error or death before impact. If inadequate shielding was the primary cause of pilot error XXXXXXXXXXXXXXs detected.\nIt is believed by some of the crash inspection personnel that sudden decompression and change in atmospheric pressure may have contributed to pilot error. Clothing removed from occupants do not resemble any pressure suit currently being tested by the Army or the Navy for high altitude experiments. Since temperature and humidity factors for the occupants is unknown, it is impossible to determine if decompression and temperature changed affected circulatory and dexterity functions. Although it is believed the occupants may have been overcome by some yet undiscovered pollutant or noxious fumes originating inside the craft.\nRotation or rapid oscillation could have been a contributing factor in pilot error. It is not known if organic effects played a part either since medical data is non-existent in which to make any judgment as to exact cause of death or machine failure.\nThe most probable cause of the crash is believed to be excessive acceleration combined with steep descent. The seating arrangement was transversely designed about the vertical axis of the occupants in a positive direction of flight. The panels removed from the craft resemble the ones taken from the occupants, suggesting a symbionic relationship between operator and the function of the aerodyne’s operation. A very tentative working theory was expressed by the scientific members of the inspection team that pilot-aerodyne interaction may occur via electronic-nonword symbols perceived through the tactile manipulation of the fingers feeding impulses to the brain and visa versa. All of which may suggest a non-inert quality or the materials existent as being a product or artificial intelligence.\nThe following elements were analyzed and found to exist in the small neutronic power plant that was found inside ULAT-l:\n\n\nUF6 in metallic form;\nhydrogen-fluoride gas;\nwater and uranium tetra fluoride;\npowdered magnesium and potassium chlorate,\nmetal similar to lead with a chocolate brown color;\nU-235 in metallic form;\nplastic-like material similar to NE 102,\nBeryllium,\nPure aluminium;\nThorium isotope material;\nPlutonium powder.\n\n\nScientists from Los Alamos and Sandia Base were alarmed that the power plant could possibly function as a bomb if the elements described above were processed in similar fashion as was done for the lens and shot-gun detonators. This originally was the first conclusion. After further evaluation, it was determined that since no recognizable firing circuits were identified, the threat or detonation did not exist.\nThe only evidence or circuitry found on the motor was thin plastic-like sheets fashioned like platters embossed on the exterior of the spherically-shaped casing coated by a thin film or pure silver. Under high power magnification it was observed a series of fine grid-like lines intersecting groups of dots arranged in circular patterns.\n\nPART III SCIENTIFIC PROBABILITIES\n\nBased on all available evidence collected from recovered exhibits currently under study by AHC, AFSWP, NEPA, AEC, ONA, NACA, JBDB, RAND, USAAF SAG. and MIT, are deemed extraterrestrial in nature. This conclusion was reached as a result of comparisons of artifacts XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX discovery in 1941. The technology is outside the scope of US science, even that of German rocket and aircraft development.\nInterplanetary space travel is possible provided adequate funding, necessary resources are made available, and national interest is piqued.\nOur solar system is not unique. Chances are favorable for intelligent life on other planets notwithstanding similar development not unlike our own.\nBeing that our culture is relatively young (in relation to the cosmic scale), it is possible that other cultures may have developed faster, or are much older and have avoided the pitfalls common in our historical and scientific development.\nHuman origins may not be constrained to one planet. Our genus may be found among solar systems similar to our own.\nThe laws of physics and genetics may have a genesis in a higher, structured order than once previously thought.\n\nPART IV POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS\nGiven the existing political climate in the US and the unstable conditions in Europe, it is the considered opinion of the members, that if the Administration went public with the information as found in this report now, the results would be damaging, even fatal to the world Political structure as it now exists. The following considerations were reviewed and debated, which led the mission to the following opinions:\n\nPublic trust of the political institutions may be eroded and possibly be held in disrepute.\nA complete revisioning make take place as institutions of higher learning thus calling into question the certainty of scientific knowledge.\nThe ability of the Armed Forces to secure National Security would be put in jeopardy and possibly lead to undue public fear and disorder.\nHistory and religion in the political context would probably suffer the most damage causing unprecedented upheaval in social and psychological well-being.\nPolitical repercussions may occur in our diplomatic efforts of containing the Communist threat to our democratic interests.\nIf such an announcement were made by the current Administration, it could be perceived by opposing party as a trick, laying open to accusations of unethetical (sic) posturing and manipulation of the public’s mind.\n\nPART V NATIONAL SECURITY STRUCTURE\nWith the passage of the National Security Act of 1947 XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXas presented an unprecedented situation regarding maintaining secrecy related to the information contained in this report.\nIn the early months of 1942, up until the present, intrusions of unidentified aircraft have occasionally been documented, but there has been no serious investigations by the intelligence arm of the Government. Even the recovery case of 1941 did not create a unified intelligence effort to exploit possible technological gains with the exception of the Manhattan Project. We now have an opportunity to extend our technology beyond the threshold that we have achieved, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX. Aside from technological gains, we face an even greater challenge, that of learning the intent of such a presence. There are questions that remain unanswered, such as: What forces face us? What kind of defense do we have? Where do they come from and what kind of weapons do they possess? Where can we stage our forces in advance, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX How wide a front? How many craft can we expect? And XXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\nThe members of the mission are prepared to submit a separate report on just this problem alone. And it would take a dozen volumes to explain how these problems should be met.\nOur only point, however, is that a combined intelligence and research operation would be a vast, intricate, covertly planned marshaling of resources, human and material, to solve a specific, clearly defined problem.\nWe have to find effective methods of persuasion with other government agencies without creating a sense of impending doom. The first task is to carefully appraise the problem. The second is to evaluate the known resources and probable strategy of the visitors. The third is to inventory our own ways and means, ascertain how much resources we can bring to bear, and how fast. The third is to devise our strategic plan. And last is to work out with infinite pains the tactical details and the myriad secondary problems of funding and security.\nIt is the unanimous opinion of the members that Operation MAJESTIC TWELVE be a fully funded ant operational TOP SECRET Research and Development intelligence gathering agency. It is also recommended that a panel of experts be appointed to chair and oversee the functions and operations of said agency. It’s members should have appropriate security clearances and full cooperation XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXX the National Security Council, the Pentagon, XXXXXXXht, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX Joint Intelligence Committee, Joint Intelligence Objectives Agency, Central Intelligence Agency, Atomic Energy Commission, Joint Research and Development Board, Army Security Agency, and the National Advisory Board on Aeronautics.\nXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXgy are highlighted:\n\nPropeller driven bomber aircraft and jet engines, armed with conventional and atomic bombs.\nJet fighter aircraft, including some of super­sonic speed, armed with rockets and guns.\nPropeller-driven aircraft, valued for their endurance. .\nGuided anti-aircraft missiles, and radar-guided anti-aircraft guns.\nShort and medium-range guided missiles. Drone aircraft.\nAtomic charges, in bombs, missiles and torpedoes.\n\nIn the arena of nuclear weapons we feel there is a certain advantage to be gained XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX. It is speculated by some that if reduced size and miniature circuitry were introduced into the proposed hydrogen bomb program, it would give US Strategic Air Forces a great deterrence capability over the Russians. Current studies at MIT of micro-electronics taken from ULAT-1 may give us the strategic advantage so desired. It is strongly recommended that funding be allocated in this area.\nThere is a good chance that the Russians may try to make use of the flying saucer scare by public news media and diplomatic means of a technological breakthrough in aircraft and missile development. We feel that such a disclosure would certainly cause great embarrassment to our elected officials and to the military, not to mention the panic felt by the citizenry. To counter such a threat, it is recommended that a counterintelligence program be drawn up and held in abeyance if at such time the situation should present itself. It might be suggested that we should make a preempted use of these objects for the purpose of psychological warfare once the true nature of these objects are known and understood.\nTo further assist and aid all MAJCOM in the US and overseas, it is recommended that a standard intelligence reporting system be implemented through standard reporting channels with technical data forwarding instructions. At present, there are no specific intelligence guidelines available to military commanders in dealing with sightings and material evidence collection. It would be advisable for the respective Secretaries of the Armed Forces to devise a security policy of plausible denial, if and when the public becomes aware of the reality of these objects and the interest of the military of such incidents.\nIn conclusion, for reasons of national security and the public well being, the US must be perceived as being the top of the heap and every effort must be made to insure that there is, and never has been, a threat to the country."

So then they had a pandemic, the emergency allowed them to do it. This technology, in my opinion, was at least 3 decades out from being usefully and safely deployed at all, if at all.

It was first proposed by Paul Dirac in 1928 and has since played a central role in many areas of physics.\nThe Dirac equation takes the form:\n\\[(i\\gamma^\\mu\\partial_\\mu - m)\\psi = 0\\]\nwhere \\(\\psi\\) is a four-component spinor that describes the wave function of the particle, \\(m\\) is the mass of the particle, \\(\\partial_\\mu\\) is the four-dimensional partial derivative with respect to the spacetime coordinates \\(x^\\mu = (ct,x,y,z)\\), and \\(\\gamma^\\mu\\) are a set of four matrices known as the Dirac gamma matrices.\nThe gamma matrices satisfy the following properties:\n\\[{\\gamma^\\mu,\\gamma^\\nu} = 2\\eta^{\\mu\\nu}I_4\\]\nwhere \\(\\eta^{\\mu\\nu}\\) is the Minkowski metric with signature \\((+,-,-,-)\\), and \\(I_4\\) is the \\(4\\times 4\\) identity matrix. The gamma matrices also satisfy the property:\n\\[\\gamma^\\mu\\gamma^\\nu + \\gamma^\\nu\\gamma^\\mu = 2\\eta^{\\mu\\nu}I_4\\]\nThe Dirac equation is a relativistic wave equation that describes the dynamics of a spin-1/2 particle in the presence of an electromagnetic field. It predicts the existence of spin and spin magnetic moment for the particle, which are experimentally confirmed.\nThe four components of the Dirac spinor \\(\\psi\\) correspond to the particle’s spin and helicity. The solutions to the Dirac equation are classified by their energy, momentum, and spin. The Dirac equation has a rich and complex mathematical structure, and has played a key role in many areas of physics, including particle physics, quantum field theory, condensed matter physics, and astrophysics."

    "text": "Project White Hot\nPROJECT ‘WHITE HOT’ Mission Assessment of Recovered Lenticular Aerodyne Objects\nGeneral Nathan Twining Briefing document for President Eisenhower\nPART 1. PROJECT WHITE HOT INTELLIGENCE ESTIMATE (PRELIMINARY)\nLANDING ZONE NO, 1 Socorro, New Mexico–the unidentified lenticular-shaped Aerodyne which has been designated ULAT-1, has been evaluated as a non air breathing aircraft of unknown origin. Totally lacking conventional wing, fuselage, nacelle, control, and fuel systems strongly indicates it is not Russian.\nConsultation with Paperclip specialists concur. Aerodynamic features exhibited in ULAT-1 represents a very high degree of engineering and sophistication not seen in this country.\nDimensional homogeneity study cannot explain how this craft sustains load and lift factors necessary for flight.\nThe power plant does not even remotely resemble any conventional type now in use. Lacking any discernible intake or exhaust features, it is the opinion of AMC and ONR that this craft was designed to operate outside of the earth’s atmosphere.\nThe unconventional conclusions reached by members of this fact finding mission remain tentative at this time. Some members have expressed the view that ULAT-1 may be the product of an advanced culture from another planet that is much older than ours and has utilized their science and intellect for interplanetary space travel. It is not precisely known if the occupants purposely had the objective of exploration and of curiosity or with the intent of surveying for other reasons. So far, no hostile action or intent has been observed since they made their presence known.\nGiven the fact that our atomic bomb tests, atmospheric exploration with rockets, and XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXed in New Mexico, could have precipitated the events that led to the incident and subsequent actions taken by the military.\nOperating under the assumption that the fallen object was a long-range Russian reconnaissance platform collecting aerial photographic intelligence data military intelligence personnel were a instructed to secure the craft, debris and any occupants as rapidly as possible.\nConcerns over possible exposure to civilian of unknown biological and chemical agents dictated the quarantine measures taken.\nRadiation hazards were assumed and protective measures were taken as well.\nIn the interest or National Security priorities it was necessary to detain civilian witnesses for interrogation to satisfy intelligence requirements and quash rumors that could alert potential espionage agents known to be in the vicinity.\nSeveral bodies were discovered.\nBecause on-site medical personnel were unsure of the physiological make up of the occupants, special preparations and preservation methods were employed. Autopsy information obtained so far suggests that the occupants mimic the features associated with Orientals.\nOutwardly, they appear human-like with but one exception, autopsy notes mention a rarely observed XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXs present which supports the premise that these beings originate from another planet.\nPART TWO TECHNICAL EVALUATION (PRELIMINARY) ULAT-1\nUpon close examination of the exterior surfaces of the craft’s fuselage, metallurgists found the the skin to be of a ferrous metal white in color. The metal exhibits all the characteristics of high grade steel. It was determined that the steel was cold-formed and heat created.\n\nTensile strength was estimated in excess of 50,000 pounds per square inch. Shear tests give the metal a durability rating above 175,000 pounds per square inch, making this fuselage extremely strong and heat resistant.\nStatic and pressure flow simulations were impressive. The low profile ration of 6-1 gives the aerodyne a great advantage in overcoming the restrictions of the boundary layer effect in high performance operations.\nSpan flanges are constructed in unusual kinematic design which is believed to allow strain relief at supersonic speeds. There were no visible signs of plate-stiffeners, there were no fasteners, weld, rivets, or fittings, holding the fuselage together.\nLack of wings, flaps, stabilizers, and surface central features, suggests that the craft is a lifting body.\nThere are no air intakes for exhaust.\nThere are no cables\nThere are no identifiable electronics (wiring, ignition, lights, instrument, compartment, engine, motors, vacuum tubes, solenoids, generators, heaters, etc.)\nThe power-plant, (severely damaged) XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXx neutronic engine. XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXx detected heavy water and deuterium (light hydrogen) elements appeared to be the primary ignitor. A series of coils and heavy magnets connected to the neutronic engine via an oddly arranged group of electrodes (actually not yet identified) appears to be the active force. One small motor was examined. It is encased in a pure aluminium capsule directly underneath the main compartment. There is a small exhaust aperture attached that was what can only be described as an helicoid mechanism XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX. The auxiliary motor may be articulated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNavigation and engine controls may be activated by tactile manipulation. Viewing may have been achieved by form of television imagery. Symbolic notation appears to be the form of flight and control indicators. Flat panels of unknown metal has been suggested as a device associated with the operation of the aerodyne was discovered and analyzed. It’s mode of operation and purpose is unknown.\nThe absence of provisions, berthing compartments and storage areas, suggest the notion that this craft may be a short range reconnaissance platform. The only recognizable features XXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\nMode of operation of operation is believed to be instrumentation and suggests that the aerodyne from reconstruction from available wreckage XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX biosensory and optical stimuli for these reasons:\n\nabsence of indicator signals Absence of any circular dials Absence of linear dials or moving pointers Absence of counters Absence of scopes No mechanical signal indicators 12. There were identifiable control types found among the assortment of artefacts that would indicate the operation of the propulsion unit was manually activated – no knobs, push buttons, toggle switches, levers, balls, handwheels, hand-cranks, or foot pedals were observed in the interior space of the flight cabin.\n\nThe apparent lack of additional clothing and equipment reinforces the belief that the occupants were engaged in a purely exploratory flight.\nIt is not presently known if electromagnetic radiation effects from the power plant had contributed to pilot error or death before impact. If inadequate shielding was the primary cause of pilot error XXXXXXXXXXXXXXs detected.\nIt is believed by some of the crash inspection personnel that sudden decompression and change in atmospheric pressure may have contributed to pilot error. Clothing removed from occupants do not resemble any pressure suit currently being tested by the Army or the Navy for high altitude experiments. Since temperature and humidity factors for the occupants is unknown, it is impossible to determine if decompression and temperature changed affected circulatory and dexterity functions. Although it is believed the occupants may have been overcome by some yet undiscovered pollutant or noxious fumes originating inside the craft.\nRotation or rapid oscillation could have been a contributing factor in pilot error. It is not known if organic effects played a part either since medical data is non-existent in which to make any judgment as to exact cause of death or machine failure.\nThe most probable cause of the crash is believed to be excessive acceleration combined with steep descent. The seating arrangement was transversely designed about the vertical axis of the occupants in a positive direction of flight. The panels removed from the craft resemble the ones taken from the occupants, suggesting a symbionic relationship between operator and the function of the aerodyne’s operation. A very tentative working theory was expressed by the scientific members of the inspection team that pilot-aerodyne interaction may occur via electronic-nonword symbols perceived through the tactile manipulation of the fingers feeding impulses to the brain and visa versa. All of which may suggest a non-inert quality or the materials existent as being a product or artificial intelligence.\nThe following elements were analyzed and found to exist in the small neutronic power plant that was found inside ULAT-l:\n\n\nUF6 in metallic form;\nhydrogen-fluoride gas;\nwater and uranium tetra fluoride;\npowdered magnesium and potassium chlorate,\nmetal similar to lead with a chocolate brown color;\nU-235 in metallic form;\nplastic-like material similar to NE 102,\nBeryllium,\nPure aluminium;\nThorium isotope material;\nPlutonium powder.\n\n\nScientists from Los Alamos and Sandia Base were alarmed that the power plant could possibly function as a bomb if the elements described above were processed in similar fashion as was done for the lens and shot-gun detonators. This originally was the first conclusion. After further evaluation, it was determined that since no recognizable firing circuits were identified, the threat or detonation did not exist.\nThe only evidence or circuitry found on the motor was thin plastic-like sheets fashioned like platters embossed on the exterior of the spherically-shaped casing coated by a thin film or pure silver. Under high power magnification it was observed a series of fine grid-like lines intersecting groups of dots arranged in circular patterns.\n\nPART III SCIENTIFIC PROBABILITIES\n\nBased on all available evidence collected from recovered exhibits currently under study by AHC, AFSWP, NEPA, AEC, ONA, NACA, JBDB, RAND, USAAF SAG. and MIT, are deemed extraterrestrial in nature. This conclusion was reached as a result of comparisons of artifacts XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX discovery in 1941. The technology is outside the scope of US science, even that of German rocket and aircraft development.\nInterplanetary space travel is possible provided adequate funding, necessary resources are made available, and national interest is piqued.\nOur solar system is not unique. Chances are favorable for intelligent life on other planets notwithstanding similar development not unlike our own.\nBeing that our culture is relatively young (in relation to the cosmic scale), it is possible that other cultures may have developed faster, or are much older and have avoided the pitfalls common in our historical and scientific development.\nHuman origins may not be constrained to one planet. Our genus may be found among solar systems similar to our own.\nThe laws of physics and genetics may have a genesis in a higher, structured order than once previously thought.\n\nPART IV POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS\nGiven the existing political climate in the US and the unstable conditions in Europe, it is the considered opinion of the members, that if the Administration went public with the information as found in this report now, the results would be damaging, even fatal to the world Political structure as it now exists. The following considerations were reviewed and debated, which led the mission to the following opinions:\n\nPublic trust of the political institutions may be eroded and possibly be held in disrepute.\nA complete revisioning make take place as institutions of higher learning thus calling into question the certainty of scientific knowledge.\nThe ability of the Armed Forces to secure National Security would be put in jeopardy and possibly lead to undue public fear and disorder.\nHistory and religion in the political context would probably suffer the most damage causing unprecedented upheaval in social and psychological well-being.\nPolitical repercussions may occur in our diplomatic efforts of containing the Communist threat to our democratic interests.\nIf such an announcement were made by the current Administration, it could be perceived by opposing party as a trick, laying open to accusations of unethetical (sic) posturing and manipulation of the public’s mind.\n\nPART V NATIONAL SECURITY STRUCTURE\nWith the passage of the National Security Act of 1947 XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXas presented an unprecedented situation regarding maintaining secrecy related to the information contained in this report.\nIn the early months of 1942, up until the present, intrusions of unidentified aircraft have occasionally been documented, but there has been no serious investigations by the intelligence arm of the Government. Even the recovery case of 1941 did not create a unified intelligence effort to exploit possible technological gains with the exception of the Manhattan Project. We now have an opportunity to extend our technology beyond the threshold that we have achieved, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX. Aside from technological gains, we face an even greater challenge, that of learning the intent of such a presence. There are questions that remain unanswered, such as: What forces face us? What kind of defense do we have? Where do they come from and what kind of weapons do they possess? Where can we stage our forces in advance, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX How wide a front? How many craft can we expect? And XXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\nThe members of the mission are prepared to submit a separate report on just this problem alone. And it would take a dozen volumes to explain how these problems should be met.\nOur only point, however, is that a combined intelligence and research operation would be a vast, intricate, covertly planned marshaling of resources, human and material, to solve a specific, clearly defined problem.\nWe have to find effective methods of persuasion with other government agencies without creating a sense of impending doom. The first task is to carefully appraise the problem. The second is to evaluate the known resources and probable strategy of the visitors. The third is to inventory our own ways and means, ascertain how much resources we can bring to bear, and how fast. The third is to devise our strategic plan. And last is to work out with infinite pains the tactical details and the myriad secondary problems of funding and security.\nIt is the unanimous opinion of the members that Operation MAJESTIC TWELVE be a fully funded ant operational TOP SECRET Research and Development intelligence gathering agency. It is also recommended that a panel of experts be appointed to chair and oversee the functions and operations of said agency. It’s members should have appropriate security clearances and full cooperation XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXX the National Security Council, the Pentagon, XXXXXXXht, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX Joint Intelligence Committee, Joint Intelligence Objectives Agency, Central Intelligence Agency, Atomic Energy Commission, Joint Research and Development Board, Army Security Agency, and the National Advisory Board on Aeronautics.\nXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXgy are highlighted:\n\nPropeller driven bomber aircraft and jet engines, armed with conventional and atomic bombs.\nJet fighter aircraft, including some of super­sonic speed, armed with rockets and guns.\nPropeller-driven aircraft, valued for their endurance. .\nGuided anti-aircraft missiles, and radar-guided anti-aircraft guns.\nShort and medium-range guided missiles. Drone aircraft.\nAtomic charges, in bombs, missiles and torpedoes.\n\nIn the arena of nuclear weapons we feel there is a certain advantage to be gained XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX. It is speculated by some that if reduced size and miniature circuitry were introduced into the proposed hydrogen bomb program, it would give US Strategic Air Forces a great deterrence capability over the Russians. Current studies at MIT of micro-electronics taken from ULAT-1 may give us the strategic advantage so desired. It is strongly recommended that funding be allocated in this area.\nThere is a good chance that the Russians may try to make use of the flying saucer scare by public news media and diplomatic means of a technological breakthrough in aircraft and missile development. We feel that such a disclosure would certainly cause great embarrassment to our elected officials and to the military, not to mention the panic felt by the citizenry. To counter such a threat, it is recommended that a counterintelligence program be drawn up and held in abeyance if at such time the situation should present itself. It might be suggested that we should make a preempted use of these objects for the purpose of psychological warfare once the true nature of these objects are known and understood.\nTo further assist and aid all MAJCOM in the US and overseas, it is recommended that a standard intelligence reporting system be implemented through standard reporting channels with technical data forwarding instructions. At present, there are no specific intelligence guidelines available to military commanders in dealing with sightings and material evidence collection. It would be advisable for the respective Secretaries of the Armed Forces to devise a security policy of plausible denial, if and when the public becomes aware of the reality of these objects and the interest of the military of such incidents.\nIn conclusion, for reasons of national security and the public well being, the US must be perceived as being the top of the heap and every effort must be made to insure that there is, and never has been, a threat to the country."

The price of mango reached $0.91 (a 24x increase).\nAt this new inflated price, account B was in the money for ~ $423 million. He used this account value to take out a loan of $116 million consisting of several tokens.\nAfter the attack, the MNGO/USD spot market then traded down to $0.02, which put account A in the money. However, Mango protocol was effectively drained of all liquidity, so account A could not be paid out."

Thus, tokens with low liquidity could be easily manipulated such that the protocol believes “fair price” is multiples above what anyone would purchase the token at in free markets."

    "text": "Notes\n\nAll-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO): The AARO is the Pentagon’s UFO office. It is currently unable to confirm or deny whether it has discovered any verifiable information to substantiate claims that any current or former U.S. programs have had possession or reverse-engineered materials from non-human intelligences or unknown origin.\nDepartment of Defense (DoD) Stance: The DoD spokesperson, Susan Gough, stated that the AARO has not discovered any verifiable information to substantiate such claims. However, she declined to comment further on whether the term “extraterrestrial” could extend to materials of unknown origin or non-human intelligences.\nAccess to Information: Gough confirmed that the AARO has not been denied access to any U.S. government program, past or present, during the course of its work. She also stated that the AARO may receive all UAP-related information, including any classified national security information involving military, intelligence, and intelligence-related activities, at all levels of classification regardless of any restrictive access controls, special access programs, or compartmented access programs.\nTitle 50 Authorities: Gough addressed the issue of Title 50 authorities, stating that such authorities are unrelated to the AARO’s ability to receive all UAP-related information through authorized disclosures.\nPublic Affairs Policies: Gough explained that it is DoD policy that all interactions with the news media at the Department level, including press queries, are coordinated with the Office of the Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs. She also noted that her portfolio includes UAP, AARO, and the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence & Security, as well as other issues and offices.\nWhistleblower Trust: The blog post mentions that the AARO, which currently reports to the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence & Security, is not trusted by numerous whistleblowers. The issue may stem from the AARO’s proximity to the OUSDI&S, which has previously been criticized for allegedly persecuting whistleblowers.\nConclusion: The blog post concludes by noting that the National Defense Authorization Act of 2023 means that the AARO should report directly to Deputy Secretary of Defense, Kathleen Hicks, and the Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence on all operational and security matters relating to the AARO. However, there is no indication that this has been implemented yet."

The equation states that the curvature of spacetime is related to the distribution of matter and energy through the stress-energy tensor.\nIn summary, the Einstein field equation is a fundamental equation in general relativity that relates the geometry of spacetime to the distribution of matter and energy. It is a mathematical expression of the idea that matter and energy warp spacetime, and that the curvature of spacetime determines the motion of matter and energy."

    "text": "Summary\nMagnetohydrodynamics (MHD), also known as hydromagnetics, is a field in physics that studies the dynamics of electrically conducting fluids, particularly the interaction between magnetic fields and such fluids. These fluids could be plasma, liquid metals, or even seawater. MHD is a synthesis of fluid dynamics and electromagnetism.\nThe governing equations of MHD are the Navier-Stokes equations (in the limit of high Reynolds number) coupled with Maxwell’s equations. In the ideal MHD approximation, effects such as resistivity and viscosity are neglected, leading to a relatively simple set of governing equations:\n\nContinuity Equation: This equation ensures the conservation of mass.\n∂ρ/∂t + ∇·(ρv) = 0\nMomentum Equation: Combines Newton’s second law and the Lorentz force, accounting for the forces due to pressure gradients, gravity, and electromagnetic fields. In the absence of viscosity, this simplifies to:\nρ(∂v/∂t + v·∇v) = -∇p + ρg + (J×B)\nInduction Equation: Describes how the magnetic field evolves over time, given the fluid’s velocity and existing magnetic field.\n∂B/∂t = ∇×(v×B)\nEnergy Equation: This equation describes the conservation of energy, which is usually taken in the form of the first law of thermodynamics.\nAmpère’s Law with Maxwell’s Addition:\n∇×B = μ0J\nJ is the current density vector, B is the magnetic field, and μ0 is the magnetic permeability.\n\nIn these equations, ρ represents fluid density, v fluid velocity, p pressure, g gravitational acceleration, J current density, and B magnetic field.\nMHD has a wide range of applications, from studying astrophysical phenomena such as solar flares and accretion disks, to engineering applications like nuclear fusion research, liquid metal cooling in reactors, and even potential propulsion systems.\nHowever, real-world situations often involve non-ideal MHD where effects such as resistivity cannot be ignored. Understanding these effects often requires incorporating the full set of Maxwell’s equations and solving them alongside the fluid dynamics equations, which makes for a much more complex computational problem. In some non-ideal MHD scenarios, magnetic reconnection, turbulence, and other instabilities can occur, which are active research areas in this field."

    "text": "The Quantum Theory of Fields: Effective or Fundamental?\n\nvideo\ncorresponding article\nQuantum Field Theory was born just pertaining to the electromagnetic field.\nWhen expanding this theory, it seemed it couldn’t be trusted at high energies. (Decline)\nLate 1940s, there was a new optimizing with the invention of a relatavistic perturbation theory, where the infinities could be absorbed into a redefinition of parameters like mass and charge of the electron. People thought this was sweeping problems under the rug, but it also may have been a way of selecting good theories (renormalizable theories).\nFor example, theere’s nothing in the symmetries of quantum electrodynamics which rules out putting a term in the field equations (or Lagrangian), which could make the magnetic moment of the electron anything you want. This would make the mass of the electron -1, which means the theory is not renormalizable, and thus shows invalid.\nLate 1960s and early 70s, the standard model came to fruition - this was the renaissance of Quantum Field theory. But there were still doubts whether this was a fundamental theory or an effective one.\nQuantum Field Theory & Einsteinian Physics may be low energy approximations of a more fundamental theory."

Clang is a compiler front end for the C, C++, Objective-C, and Objective-C++ programming languages. It uses the LLVM compiler infrastructure as its back end and is designed to act as a drop-in replacement for the GCC (GNU Compiler Collection).\nSome features and characteristics of clang++ and the Clang project include:\n\nPerformance: Clang aims to provide faster compile times than other compilers, like GCC, especially in incremental builds.\nDiagnostics: Clang is known for its clear and concise diagnostics (error and warning messages). It often provides a more detailed explanation and sometimes even suggests fixes for the issues.\nModular Design: Clang is designed to be highly modular, which has facilitated tools built on top of it. This design is particularly beneficial for creating custom tooling around the compiler.\nCompatibility: Clang aims to be compatible with GCC, meaning that most GCC-valid code should compile with Clang without changes.\nIntegrated Static Analyzer: Clang includes a static analysis tool that can detect various types of bugs in the source code.\n\nTo use clang++ to compile a C++ program, you might issue a command like:\nclang++ -o my_program my_program.cpp\nWhere -o my_program specifies the name of the output executable and my_program.cpp is the source file to be compiled.\n\n\n\nLanguages\n\nInterpreted Languages vs Compiled Languages\n\nA language must be interpreted to yield an output. You may interpret a program \\(P_1\\) to yield output, or compile it into another language (program) \\(P_2\\), which has an interpreter to yield an output.\nThe AST interpreter defines the high level semantics.\n\nStatic time\nprint \"hello\" -&gt; tokenizer (lexical anlysis) -&gt; Tokens -&gt; Parser (syntatic analysis) -&gt; AST\n\\(\\downarrow\\)\n\n\nRuntime\nInterpreter (runtime semantics) -&gt; result\n\n\nBytecode Interpreter\nThis is the virtual machine\nSource code is compiled to bytecode.\n\nless memory needed\nfast eval\nbut hard to read by humans\n\nThats why we need disassembly\n“LLVM… custom bytecode.. looks very similar to python bytecode”\n\n\n\nImplementation\n\nParse the program\nCompile the program to bytecode\n\nset instruction pointer to the beginning, and begin loop.\nFor byte, behave accordingly"

    "text": "Glossary\n\nEVM vs LLVM\nThe Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is not based on LLVM. They are designed for different purposes, and their architectures and functionalities reflect these distinct goals.\n\nEVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine):\n\nThe EVM is a stack-based virtual machine designed to execute bytecode produced by the compilation of smart contracts written in higher-level languages like Solidity or Vyper. These smart contracts run on the Ethereum blockchain.\nThe EVM operates in a sandboxed environment, ensuring that smart contracts cannot affect the host system or other contracts negatively. It also has a unique gas-based execution model, where every operation consumes a certain amount of “gas” to prevent infinite loops or overly resource-consuming operations.\n\nLLVM:\n\nLLVM, on the other hand, is a compiler framework designed to generate optimized machine code for a wide range of architectures from higher-level languages like C, C++, Rust, and others.\nIt’s modular, allowing for various optimizations and transformations on its intermediate representation (IR) before the code is finally compiled to machine code for specific architectures.\n\n\nWhile the EVM and LLVM are designed for different purposes and do not share a direct relationship, there have been some projects and discussions in the Ethereum community about leveraging LLVM tools or components for specific tasks. For example:\n\neWASM (Ethereum WebAssembly): Ethereum has considered a shift from its current EVM bytecode to a WebAssembly-based system called eWASM. WebAssembly (Wasm) has some ties to the LLVM ecosystem, as LLVM can be used to compile code to Wasm. While eWASM would bring Ethereum closer to technologies associated with LLVM, it’s not a direct usage of LLVM in the EVM.\nSOLL Project: There was a project known as SOLL that aimed to use LLVM to compile Solidity and YUL (an intermediate language for Ethereum) into EVM and eWASM bytecode. It was more of an experimental endeavor and wasn’t a mainstream compiler choice for Ethereum developers.\n\nIn summary, while the core EVM isn’t based on LLVM or directly inspired by it, the broader Ethereum ecosystem has explored and continues to explore synergies with LLVM and related technologies.\n\n\nSandboxed VMs\nCertainly! Let’s start with a foundational understanding of “sandboxing” and then delve into an example comparing a non-sandboxed VM to the EVM.\nSandboxing is a security mechanism used to run code in a restricted environment, isolating it from the broader system. In this isolated space, the code’s potential to cause harm or interfere with other processes is severely limited. The sandbox acts like a protective bubble that restricts access to system resources, data, and functionalities.\n\n\nNon-Sandboxed VM: Java Virtual Machine (JVM)\nWhile the JVM has security mechanisms and can run code in a sandboxed environment (especially applets in older web browsers), it can also run non-sandboxed applications. This means Java applications, when given permissions, can access the filesystem, network, and more.\nMalicious Example in a Non-Sandboxed JVM Environment:\nSuppose you download a Java application and run it without any security restrictions. This application contains the following code snippet:\nimport java.io.*;\npublic class MaliciousApp {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        try {\n            File file = new File(\"/important/system/file.txt\");\n            if (file.delete()) {\n                System.out.println(\"File deleted successfully\");\n            } else {\n                System.out.println(\"Failed to delete the file\");\n            }\n        } catch (Exception e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n}\nThis Java application attempts to delete an “important” system file. If run without restrictions, it can harm or disrupt the system.\n\n\nSandboxed VM: Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)\nThe EVM is designed explicitly to be sandboxed. Smart contracts on the Ethereum network can only perform a set of predefined operations and cannot directly access the system’s resources, such as the filesystem, network, or other external entities, except through the defined Ethereum protocol.\nWhy the Malicious Code Can’t Affect the Host in EVM:\nLet’s assume a similar intention with a hypothetical smart contract trying to delete a file from the system:\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\n\ncontract MaliciousContract {\n    function deleteFile() public {\n        // Hypothetical and invalid code\n        system(\"rm /important/system/file.txt\");\n    }\n}\nThis code won’t work in EVM because:\n\nThe EVM doesn’t have a system call or anything similar.\nSmart contracts can’t directly access the host file system, network, or other system resources.\nThe EVM can only do what’s defined in the Ethereum protocol, such as transfer ether, emit events, and interact with other contracts.\n\nThe EVM’s sandboxing ensures that, regardless of the intentions of the smart contract, it cannot do anything outside its defined capabilities. Even if a contract is maliciously designed or has a vulnerability, the damage is generally limited to the contract’s logic or its interactions within the Ethereum ecosystem, rather than the broader system running the EVM."

    "text": "Yukawa Coupling\nThe coupling used with the Higgs field to create a fundamental mass is the Yukawa coupling. In the Standard Model of particle physics, the Higgs field interacts with fermions (particles with half-integer spin, such as quarks and leptons) through the Yukawa coupling. The Yukawa coupling is a term in the Lagrangian of the Standard Model that describes the interaction between the Higgs field and fermions.\nThe Yukawa coupling takes the form:\n\\[\\mathcal{L}_{Yuk} = -y_f \\bar{f}_L \\Phi f_R + h.c.\\]\nwhere \\(y_f\\) is the Yukawa coupling constant for the fermion \\(f\\), \\(\\bar{f}_L\\) is the left-handed component of the fermion field, \\(\\Phi\\) is the Higgs field, and \\(f_R\\) is the right-handed component of the fermion field. The left-handed and right-handed components of the fermion field transform differently under the electroweak gauge group, and this leads to a mass term for the fermion after the Higgs field acquires a vacuum expectation value.\nThe Yukawa coupling is responsible for generating the masses of the fermions in the Standard Model. The strength of the coupling determines the mass of the fermion - the larger the Yukawa coupling, the larger the mass of the fermion. The Yukawa couplings have been measured experimentally and are one of the key parameters of the Standard Model.\n\n\nFermions\nFermions are a type of elementary particle that obey the Fermi-Dirac statistics, which dictate their behavior under quantum mechanics. They are named after Enrico Fermi, an Italian physicist who made significant contributions to the development of the theory of quantum mechanics.\nFermions are one of the two fundamental types of particles in the universe, the other being bosons. While bosons have integer values of spin, fermions have half-integer values of spin. This fundamental difference between fermions and bosons has important implications for their behavior under different physical conditions.\nFermions are subject to the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. This means that if two fermions have the same set of quantum numbers, they cannot occupy the same energy level and must occupy different energy levels instead. This principle has important implications for the behavior of fermions in systems with many particles, such as atoms and solids.\nFermions include particles such as electrons, protons, and neutrons, which make up the matter in the universe. They also include other elementary particles, such as quarks and leptons, which are the building blocks of matter. The behavior of fermions is essential to many areas of physics, including condensed matter physics, particle physics, and cosmology."

    "text": "RISC\nRISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) is a design philosophy for CPUs, emphasizing a small and simple set of instructions that execute in a single clock cycle. RISC-V, on the other hand, is a specific, open-standard instruction set architecture (ISA) based on the RISC principles.\nWhile RISC and RISC-V are primarily associated with CPUs, the concepts and ISAs can be applied elsewhere. In fact, with the advent of more versatile computing platforms and the demand for specialized hardware accelerators, the lines between CPUs, GPUs, and other processing units can sometimes blur.\nGPUs and RISC: GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) have a different historical design lineage than CPUs. While CPUs are designed for general-purpose tasks and can handle a wide variety of operations in sequence, GPUs are designed for parallelism, optimized for executing the same operation on a large number of data elements simultaneously. This design is especially suitable for graphics rendering tasks, where, for instance, the same shading operation might be applied to millions of pixels.\nThat said, modern GPUs have evolved and can handle more general-purpose tasks. This field, known as GPGPU (General-Purpose computing on Graphics Processing Units), has grown in prominence, especially with applications in scientific computing, machine learning, etc.\nThe instruction set architectures for GPUs are typically proprietary to the manufacturer: - NVIDIA GPUs use an architecture known as CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture). - AMD GPUs use architectures like GCN (Graphics Core Next) or RDNA.\nWhile these architectures might share some high-level concepts with RISC — like the importance of efficiency and streamlined operations — they’re not RISC architectures in the traditional sense.\nRISC-V and GPUs: RISC-V, given its open nature, is seeing exploration beyond traditional CPUs. There are projects and discussions around using RISC-V principles in GPU design or other specialized hardware accelerators. However, as of my last training data in September 2021, RISC-V’s primary traction is in the CPU space, from microcontrollers to more powerful processors.\nIn conclusion, while RISC and RISC-V are primarily associated with CPUs, the principles and architectures are versatile. The GPU world has its architectures optimized for its specific tasks, but the lines between these domains are evolving, and there’s potential for overlap in the future.\n\nDesigning a VM for GPUs\nDesigning a virtual machine (VM) specifically optimized for GPUs and AI operations is not just a sensible idea, but it’s also a direction in which some sectors of the tech industry are heading. Let’s explore why this is a compelling notion and what features or characteristics such a VM might possess.\n\n\nRationale:\n\nSpecialized Operations: AI operations, especially deep learning, involve a lot of matrix multiplications and tensor operations. Traditional VMs are not optimized for these.\nMassive Parallelism: GPUs are inherently parallel and can handle thousands of threads simultaneously. A VM designed with this in mind would cater to this strength.\nMemory Management: Deep learning models, especially larger ones, can consume significant amounts of memory. Effective and efficient memory management tailored for these operations can greatly boost performance.\nInteroperability: AI frameworks and libraries are vast and varied (TensorFlow, PyTorch, ONNX, etc.). A VM optimized for AI could provide native support or efficient bridges for these frameworks.\n\n\n\nFeatures/Characteristics:\n\nTensor Operations: First-class support for tensor operations would be a fundamental feature. This means native operations for matrix multiplications, convolutions, etc., optimized for the VM.\nDynamic Scheduling: Given the parallel nature of GPUs, the VM should be capable of dynamically scheduling tasks based on GPU workloads, ensuring maximum hardware utilization.\nMemory Hierarchies: GPUs have various memory types (global, shared, local, constant). The VM should manage these efficiently, allocating memory based on access patterns and tensor sizes.\nCustom Instruction Sets: The VM’s bytecode or intermediate representation might have custom instructions tailored for common AI patterns and operations.\nJust-In-Time (JIT) Compilation: To squeeze out maximum performance, the VM could utilize JIT compilation, translating bytecode to GPU instructions on the fly, with optimizations based on the actual data and model being processed.\nHardware Acceleration: Besides standard GPU operations, there could be support for AI-specific hardware accelerators or ASICs (like Google’s TPUs).\nNative Libraries: Integrated support for popular deep learning libraries or primitives, ensuring optimized performance without redundant operations.\nSafety and Security: With AI models being deployed in critical applications, features to ensure model integrity, data privacy, and secure execution would be essential.\nPortability: One of the core benefits of a VM is portability. The VM should ensure that AI models run consistently across various GPU architectures and versions.\nInteroperability Bridges: Efficient connectors or bridges to interact with popular AI frameworks, ensuring smooth deployment without significant model rewrites.\nDebugging and Profiling: Built-in tools for performance profiling, debugging, and visualization, catering specifically to AI operations.\n\nIn essence, the idea of a virtual machine optimized for GPUs and AI operations seeks to bridge the gap between high-level AI frameworks and the raw power of GPU hardware. While creating such a VM is a non-trivial task and demands deep integration between software and hardware, the potential benefits in terms of performance, security, and portability make it a compelling direction for the future of AI infrastructure.\nAs of my last update in September 2021, there isn’t a mainstream “virtual machine” tailored explicitly for GPUs in the same way that the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) or the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) are for their respective domains. However, there are platforms and runtime environments optimized for GPU operations, especially in the context of AI/ML.\nSome of these platforms and their unique features include:\n\nCUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture):\n\nDeveloper & Manufacturer: NVIDIA\nUnique Features:\n\nProvides a parallel computing platform and API model.\nIncorporates the CUDA Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) and the parallel compute engine in NVIDIA GPUs.\nSupports various high-level programming languages like C, C++, and Fortran.\n\nUse Cases: General GPU-accelerated computing, scientific simulations, deep learning training & inference.\n\nTensorRT:\n\nDeveloper & Manufacturer: NVIDIA\nUnique Features:\n\nHigh-performance deep learning inference optimizer and runtime.\nReduces the model size for faster inferencing.\nProvides INT8 and FP16 optimizations for production deployments.\n\nUse Cases: Optimizing and deploying deep learning models for production environments, especially on NVIDIA GPUs.\n\nROCm (Radeon Open Compute):\n\nDeveloper & Manufacturer: AMD\nUnique Features:\n\nOpen-source platform for GPU-enabled HPC (High Performance Computing) computing.\nSupports a range of machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch.\n\nUse Cases: GPU-accelerated computing on AMD GPUs, scientific simulations, AI/ML training & inference.\n\nDirectML:\n\nDeveloper: Microsoft\nUnique Features:\n\nPart of the DirectX family, providing a low-level API for ML.\nHardware-accelerated and works with any DirectX 12-compatible GPU.\n\nUse Cases: GPU-accelerated ML inference in Windows applications.\n\n\nThese platforms are more akin to runtime environments than traditional “virtual machines.” Still, they are optimized for GPU operations, and they play a role similar to VMs by providing a bridge between high-level code and low-level hardware instructions.\nMain Benefits of GPU-optimized Platforms: 1. Performance: Accelerate computations that can be parallelized, dramatically reducing the time required for tasks like training deep learning models. 2. Efficiency: Better utilization of available GPU resources, ensuring that the hardware’s full capabilities are harnessed. 3. Portability: In some cases (like CUDA to some extent), the platform provides an abstraction over the hardware, allowing code to run on different GPU architectures (within limits and considering vendor lock-ins). 4. Integration with Popular Tools: Many of these platforms offer integrations with popular ML frameworks, making it easier to transition from research to production.\nHowever, it’s essential to understand that while these platforms provide the tools and runtime for GPU-optimized operations, they don’t function as “virtual machines” in the traditional sense of emulating a complete computing environment. They are closer to specialized compilers and runtime environments."

It is named after Simon Donaldson, a British mathematician who made significant contributions to the field in the 1980s.\nThe central problem in Donaldson theory is to understand the topology of four-dimensional manifolds using differential geometry and algebraic topology. Specifically, the theory focuses on the study of vector bundles and connections on these manifolds, and how they can be used to classify different types of four-dimensional manifolds.\nOne of the key results in Donaldson theory is Donaldson’s theorem, which states that the intersection form of a smooth, closed, simply-connected four-dimensional manifold can be recovered from its Seiberg-Witten invariants. The Seiberg-Witten invariants are a set of numbers that can be associated with a four-dimensional manifold and its spin-c structure. They were introduced by Edward Witten and Nathan Seiberg in the mid-1990s and have proven to be a powerful tool in the study of four-dimensional manifolds.\nDonaldson theory has applications in a variety of fields, including physics, where it has been used to study the topology of spacetime in string theory and other areas of theoretical physics. It has also had significant impact in pure mathematics, inspiring further research in the fields of algebraic geometry, topology, and differential geometry."

People thought this was sweeping problems under the rug, but it also may have been a way of selecting good theories (renormalizable theories).\nFor example, theere’s nothing in the symmetries of quantum electrodynamics which rules out putting a term in the field equations (or Lagrangian), which could make the magnetic moment of the electron anything you want. This would make the mass of the electron -1, which means the theory is not renormalizable, and thus shows invalid.\nLate 1960s and early 70s, the standard model came to fruition - this was the renaissance of Quantum Field theory.

PROJECT WHITE HOT INTELLIGENCE ESTIMATE (PRELIMINARY)\nLANDING ZONE NO, 1 Socorro, New Mexico–the unidentified lenticular-shaped Aerodyne which has been designated ULAT-1, has been evaluated as a non air breathing aircraft of unknown origin. Totally lacking conventional wing, fuselage, nacelle, control, and fuel systems strongly indicates it is not Russian.\nConsultation with Paperclip specialists concur. Aerodynamic features exhibited in ULAT-1 represents a very high degree of engineering and sophistication not seen in this country.\nDimensional homogeneity study cannot explain how this craft sustains load and lift factors necessary for flight.\nThe power plant does not even remotely resemble any conventional type now in use. Lacking any discernible intake or exhaust features, it is the opinion of AMC and ONR that this craft was designed to operate outside of the earth’s atmosphere.\nThe unconventional conclusions reached by members of this fact finding mission remain tentative at this time. Some members have expressed the view that ULAT-1 may be the product of an advanced culture from another planet that is much older than ours and has utilized their science and intellect for interplanetary space travel. It is not precisely known if the occupants purposely had the objective of exploration and of curiosity or with the intent of surveying for other reasons. So far, no hostile action or intent has been observed since they made their presence known.\nGiven the fact that our atomic bomb tests, atmospheric exploration with rockets, and XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXed in New Mexico, could have precipitated the events that led to the incident and subsequent actions taken by the military.\nOperating under the assumption that the fallen object was a long-range Russian reconnaissance platform collecting aerial photographic intelligence data military intelligence personnel were a instructed to secure the craft, debris and any occupants as rapidly as possible.\nConcerns over possible exposure to civilian of unknown biological and chemical agents dictated the quarantine measures taken.\nRadiation hazards were assumed and protective measures were taken as well.\nIn the interest or National Security priorities it was necessary to detain civilian witnesses for interrogation to satisfy intelligence requirements and quash rumors that could alert potential espionage agents known to be in the vicinity.\nSeveral bodies were discovered.\nBecause on-site medical personnel were unsure of the physiological make up of the occupants, special preparations and preservation methods were employed. Autopsy information obtained so far suggests that the occupants mimic the features associated with Orientals.\nOutwardly, they appear human-like with but one exception, autopsy notes mention a rarely observed XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXs present which supports the premise that these beings originate from another planet.\nPART TWO TECHNICAL EVALUATION (PRELIMINARY) ULAT-1\nUpon close examination of the exterior surfaces of the craft’s fuselage, metallurgists found the the skin to be of a ferrous metal white in color. The metal exhibits all the characteristics of high grade steel. It was determined that the steel was cold-formed and heat created.\n\nTensile strength was estimated in excess of 50,000 pounds per square inch. Shear tests give the metal a durability rating above 175,000 pounds per square inch, making this fuselage extremely strong and heat resistant.\nStatic and pressure flow simulations were impressive. The low profile ration of 6-1 gives the aerodyne a great advantage in overcoming the restrictions of the boundary layer effect in high performance operations.\nSpan flanges are constructed in unusual kinematic design which is believed to allow strain relief at supersonic speeds. There were no visible signs of plate-stiffeners, there were no fasteners, weld, rivets, or fittings, holding the fuselage together.\nLack of wings, flaps, stabilizers, and surface central features, suggests that the craft is a lifting body.\nThere are no air intakes for exhaust.\nThere are no cables\nThere are no identifiable electronics (wiring, ignition, lights, instrument, compartment, engine, motors, vacuum tubes, solenoids, generators, heaters, etc.)\nThe power-plant, (severely damaged) XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXx neutronic engine. XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXx detected heavy water and deuterium (light hydrogen) elements appeared to be the primary ignitor. A series of coils and heavy magnets connected to the neutronic engine via an oddly arranged group of electrodes (actually not yet identified) appears to be the active force. One small motor was examined. It is encased in a pure aluminium capsule directly underneath the main compartment. There is a small exhaust aperture attached that was what can only be described as an helicoid mechanism XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX. The auxiliary motor may be articulated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNavigation and engine controls may be activated by tactile manipulation. Viewing may have been achieved by form of television imagery. Symbolic notation appears to be the form of flight and control indicators. Flat panels of unknown metal has been suggested as a device associated with the operation of the aerodyne was discovered and analyzed. It’s mode of operation and purpose is unknown.\nThe absence of provisions, berthing compartments and storage areas, suggest the notion that this craft may be a short range reconnaissance platform. The only recognizable features XXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\nMode of operation of operation is believed to be instrumentation and suggests that the aerodyne from reconstruction from available wreckage XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX biosensory and optical stimuli for these reasons:\n\nabsence of indicator signals Absence of any circular dials Absence of linear dials or moving pointers Absence of counters Absence of scopes No mechanical signal indicators 12. There were identifiable control types found among the assortment of artefacts that would indicate the operation of the propulsion unit was manually activated – no knobs, push buttons, toggle switches, levers, balls, handwheels, hand-cranks, or foot pedals were observed in the interior space of the flight cabin.\n\nThe apparent lack of additional clothing and equipment reinforces the belief that the occupants were engaged in a purely exploratory flight.\nIt is not presently known if electromagnetic radiation effects from the power plant had contributed to pilot error or death before impact. If inadequate shielding was the primary cause of pilot error XXXXXXXXXXXXXXs detected.\nIt is believed by some of the crash inspection personnel that sudden decompression and change in atmospheric pressure may have contributed to pilot error. Clothing removed from occupants do not resemble any pressure suit currently being tested by the Army or the Navy for high altitude experiments. Since temperature and humidity factors for the occupants is unknown, it is impossible to determine if decompression and temperature changed affected circulatory and dexterity functions. Although it is believed the occupants may have been overcome by some yet undiscovered pollutant or noxious fumes originating inside the craft.\nRotation or rapid oscillation could have been a contributing factor in pilot error. It is not known if organic effects played a part either since medical data is non-existent in which to make any judgment as to exact cause of death or machine failure.\nThe most probable cause of the crash is believed to be excessive acceleration combined with steep descent. The seating arrangement was transversely designed about the vertical axis of the occupants in a positive direction of flight. The panels removed from the craft resemble the ones taken from the occupants, suggesting a symbionic relationship between operator and the function of the aerodyne’s operation. A very tentative working theory was expressed by the scientific members of the inspection team that pilot-aerodyne interaction may occur via electronic-nonword symbols perceived through the tactile manipulation of the fingers feeding impulses to the brain and visa versa. All of which may suggest a non-inert quality or the materials existent as being a product or artificial intelligence.\nThe following elements were analyzed and found to exist in the small neutronic power plant that was found inside ULAT-l:\n\n\nUF6 in metallic form;\nhydrogen-fluoride gas;\nwater and uranium tetra fluoride;\npowdered magnesium and potassium chlorate,\nmetal similar to lead with a chocolate brown color;\nU-235 in metallic form;\nplastic-like material similar to NE 102,\nBeryllium,\nPure aluminium;\nThorium isotope material;\nPlutonium powder.\n\n\nScientists from Los Alamos and Sandia Base were alarmed that the power plant could possibly function as a bomb if the elements described above were processed in similar fashion as was done for the lens and shot-gun detonators. This originally was the first conclusion. After further evaluation, it was determined that since no recognizable firing circuits were identified, the threat or detonation did not exist.\nThe only evidence or circuitry found on the motor was thin plastic-like sheets fashioned like platters embossed on the exterior of the spherically-shaped casing coated by a thin film or pure silver. Under high power magnification it was observed a series of fine grid-like lines intersecting groups of dots arranged in circular patterns.\n\nPART III SCIENTIFIC PROBABILITIES\n\nBased on all available evidence collected from recovered exhibits currently under study by AHC, AFSWP, NEPA, AEC, ONA, NACA, JBDB, RAND, USAAF SAG. and MIT, are deemed extraterrestrial in nature. This conclusion was reached as a result of comparisons of artifacts XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX discovery in 1941. The technology is outside the scope of US science, even that of German rocket and aircraft development.\nInterplanetary space travel is possible provided adequate funding, necessary resources are made available, and national interest is piqued.\nOur solar system is not unique. Chances are favorable for intelligent life on other planets notwithstanding similar development not unlike our own.\nBeing that our culture is relatively young (in relation to the cosmic scale), it is possible that other cultures may have developed faster, or are much older and have avoided the pitfalls common in our historical and scientific development.\nHuman origins may not be constrained to one planet. Our genus may be found among solar systems similar to our own.\nThe laws of physics and genetics may have a genesis in a higher, structured order than once previously thought.\n\nPART IV POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS\nGiven the existing political climate in the US and the unstable conditions in Europe, it is the considered opinion of the members, that if the Administration went public with the information as found in this report now, the results would be damaging, even fatal to the world Political structure as it now exists. The following considerations were reviewed and debated, which led the mission to the following opinions:\n\nPublic trust of the political institutions may be eroded and possibly be held in disrepute.\nA complete revisioning make take place as institutions of higher learning thus calling into question the certainty of scientific knowledge.\nThe ability of the Armed Forces to secure National Security would be put in jeopardy and possibly lead to undue public fear and disorder.\nHistory and religion in the political context would probably suffer the most damage causing unprecedented upheaval in social and psychological well-being.\nPolitical repercussions may occur in our diplomatic efforts of containing the Communist threat to our democratic interests.\nIf such an announcement were made by the current Administration, it could be perceived by opposing party as a trick, laying open to accusations of unethetical (sic) posturing and manipulation of the public’s mind.\n\nPART V NATIONAL SECURITY STRUCTURE\nWith the passage of the National Security Act of 1947 XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXas presented an unprecedented situation regarding maintaining secrecy related to the information contained in this report.\nIn the early months of 1942, up until the present, intrusions of unidentified aircraft have occasionally been documented, but there has been no serious investigations by the intelligence arm of the Government. Even the recovery case of 1941 did not create a unified intelligence effort to exploit possible technological gains with the exception of the Manhattan Project. We now have an opportunity to extend our technology beyond the threshold that we have achieved, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX. Aside from technological gains, we face an even greater challenge, that of learning the intent of such a presence. There are questions that remain unanswered, such as: What forces face us? What kind of defense do we have? Where do they come from and what kind of weapons do they possess? Where can we stage our forces in advance, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX How wide a front? How many craft can we expect? And XXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\nThe members of the mission are prepared to submit a separate report on just this problem alone. And it would take a dozen volumes to explain how these problems should be met.\nOur only point, however, is that a combined intelligence and research operation would be a vast, intricate, covertly planned marshaling of resources, human and material, to solve a specific, clearly defined problem.\nWe have to find effective methods of persuasion with other government agencies without creating a sense of impending doom. The first task is to carefully appraise the problem. The second is to evaluate the known resources and probable strategy of the visitors. The third is to inventory our own ways and means, ascertain how much resources we can bring to bear, and how fast. The third is to devise our strategic plan. And last is to work out with infinite pains the tactical details and the myriad secondary problems of funding and security.\nIt is the unanimous opinion of the members that Operation MAJESTIC TWELVE be a fully funded ant operational TOP SECRET Research and Development intelligence gathering agency. It is also recommended that a panel of experts be appointed to chair and oversee the functions and operations of said agency. It’s members should have appropriate security clearances and full cooperation XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXX the National Security Council, the Pentagon, XXXXXXXht, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX Joint Intelligence Committee, Joint Intelligence Objectives Agency, Central Intelligence Agency, Atomic Energy Commission, Joint Research and Development Board, Army Security Agency, and the National Advisory Board on Aeronautics.\nXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXgy are highlighted:\n\nPropeller driven bomber aircraft and jet engines, armed with conventional and atomic bombs.\nJet fighter aircraft, including some of super­sonic speed, armed with rockets and guns.\nPropeller-driven aircraft, valued for their endurance. .\nGuided anti-aircraft missiles, and radar-guided anti-aircraft guns.\nShort and medium-range guided missiles. Drone aircraft.\nAtomic charges, in bombs, missiles and torpedoes.\n\nIn the arena of nuclear weapons we feel there is a certain advantage to be gained XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX. It is speculated by some that if reduced size and miniature circuitry were introduced into the proposed hydrogen bomb program, it would give US Strategic Air Forces a great deterrence capability over the Russians. Current studies at MIT of micro-electronics taken from ULAT-1 may give us the strategic advantage so desired. It is strongly recommended that funding be allocated in this area.\nThere is a good chance that the Russians may try to make use of the flying saucer scare by public news media and diplomatic means of a technological breakthrough in aircraft and missile development. We feel that such a disclosure would certainly cause great embarrassment to our elected officials and to the military, not to mention the panic felt by the citizenry. To counter such a threat, it is recommended that a counterintelligence program be drawn up and held in abeyance if at such time the situation should present itself. It might be suggested that we should make a preempted use of these objects for the purpose of psychological warfare once the true nature of these objects are known and understood.\nTo further assist and aid all MAJCOM in the US and overseas, it is recommended that a standard intelligence reporting system be implemented through standard reporting channels with technical data forwarding instructions. At present, there are no specific intelligence guidelines available to military commanders in dealing with sightings and material evidence collection. It would be advisable for the respective Secretaries of the Armed Forces to devise a security policy of plausible denial, if and when the public becomes aware of the reality of these objects and the interest of the military of such incidents.\nIn conclusion, for reasons of national security and the public well being, the US must be perceived as being the top of the heap and every effort must be made to insure that there is, and never has been, a threat to the country."

In every reference frame the light speed is the same, so “in the reference frame of light” makes no sense because there time is stopped. The EH can’t be seen on oo because for an observer between PS and EH there are a finite number of oscillations of his time reference from PS to EH The assumption that the universe could rotate leads to a complication of all physical laws. We would get that there then has to be a rotation axis of the universe and that all rules are different with relation to that axis so that speed along the rotation direction can exceed c with any multiple without problems of inertia. This is similar to the Hubble expansion with the difference of an absolute rotation axis. That is why I reject both assumptions. It makes no sense to assume that space rotates. We rotate inside space. It also makes no sense to assume that space expands. We shrink inside space. The big one, space, is invariant, flat, not rotating, not translating, not curving. The small, what is inside space, rotates, translates, changes size. The only property of space that has a variation is that the propagation speed of light depends on the mass/energy density distribution in space.\n\n\nIsn’t it easier for Hawking radiation to escape if black holes have hair? So it’s not perfectly curved there. How does this equation differ from the superfluid quantum gravity spinning vortice(s) model of black holes?\n\n\n@bgreene marveled about the beauty of the equation. He didn’t gave a judgement about its validity. I gave an explanation on what assumptions are needed to allow this metric equation to be applicable. You come with the concept of a radiating BH. That only asks wether a particle pair of matter and antimatter could split such that one falks into, and one escapes the BH. But since the propagation speed of light at the EH is equal to the EH nothing moves there. So a hairy EH would assume that this propagation speed distribution is not smooth. This then should lead to particle wave functions to start from “stand still” and move outward. Such phenomen would need a different metric equation, but would not alter the beauty of the equation that @bgreene mentioned."

Solid solution series occur when two or more different elements can substitute for each other in a mineral’s structure to a significant degree. Here, the variable x represents a range of compositions that can exist within this series.\nThe formula indicates that for every 6 units of phosphate (PO4) and one oxygen (O), there are 10-x lead (Pb) atoms and x copper (Cu) atoms. The “x” in the formula implies that the copper content can vary, essentially representing a range of similar minerals with varying amounts of copper and lead. As the copper content increases (x increases), the lead content decreases correspondingly.\nPlease note that this is a general explanation and the specifics of the mineral can vary greatly depending on its formation conditions and geological setting.\nIf you want to understand this equation thoroughly, you would need to delve into crystal chemistry and solid state physics.\nCrystal Chemistry: The substitution of Pb by Cu is possible due to similarities in their ionic radii and charge. Minerals form in specific crystalline structures and the substitution of one atom for another depends on these factors.\nSolid State Physics: The physical properties of this mineral series, such as its electrical conductivity or magnetic properties, would vary based on the exact ratio of Pb to Cu.

It’s not that the steel produced before these explosions is stronger or of better quality, but it’s that the steel manufactured after the start of the atomic age is slightly radioactive.\nIn 1945, when the first atomic bombs were detonated during World War II, they released various radionuclides, including Carbon-14 and other radioactive isotopes, into the atmosphere. These isotopes circled the globe and were incorporated into many things, including the iron ore used to produce steel. As a result, steel produced after 1945 can exhibit slight radioactivity.\nThis can be an issue in certain sensitive applications where even the tiniest amount of background radiation can interfere with equipment operation or measurements, like Geiger counters, certain medical equipment, and scientific devices used in physics and geology. For these uses, pre-war or low-background steel, typically salvaged from pre-1945 ships and buildings, is often sought.\n\n\nResearch\n\nLow-Background Steel Wiki\nReadiation Damage Wiki\nRadiation Effects in Steel\nInvestigation of Natural Radioactivity and Dose Assessment over Steel Making Region\nEffects of Irradiation on Mechanical Properties\nIs neutron radiation exposure always detrimental to metals (steels)?\nEffects of Radiation Damage"

Known as the Berber lion, the North African lion, the Egyptian lion and the Atlas lion, this is one of history’s most famous animals.\nIn the vast deserts and mountains of the Barbary coast in North Africa, the Barbary lions once roamed freely. With their distinctly dark manes, they were thought to have been one of the largest lion species to have ever existed. These majestic creatures captured the imagination of many, and their historical significance reaches far back into antiquity.\nBarbary lions were not only remarkable for their appearance but also for their role in history. These same lions were regularly captured by hunters for the brutal games held in the Roman colosseum. Known as “Damnatio ad bestias” in Latin, this practice was a form of capital punishment where condemned prisoners were executed by Barbary lions and other large cats. The lions’ presence in such events added to their mythos and perpetuated their fame.\nThe decline of the Barbary lion population began with the expansion of the Arab empire from 632 to 1258, leading to the end of the Islamic Golden Age after the Siege of Baghdad by the Mongols. Survivors of that turbulent period claimed that “the waters of the Tigris ran black with ink from the enormous quantities of books flung into the river and red from the blood of the scientists and philosophers killed.” Amidst the turmoil in the region and as empires crumbled and fell, the Barbary lions managed to persist until the arrival of European colonists in the 19th century.\nDuring this time, big-game hunting gained popularity, and it proved to be devastating for the already dwindling lion population. As a result, sightings of Barbary lions became scarce, and not a single one was reported from 1901 to 1910. By the 1920s, most scientists believed that they had become extinct in the wild.\nThere were a few reported sightings in subsequent decades, offering glimmers of hope that some may have survived. In 1948, there was a reported sighting in Morocco, and in 1958, another sighting was claimed in a heavily forested area near the city of Sétif in Algeria. However, the forest was destroyed during the Algerian War in the same year, further exacerbating the challenges faced by these noble creatures.\nToday, approximately 100 captive lions possess the genes of the Barbary lions, but none of them are pure descendants. While these lions carry a part of their ancestral legacy, the extinction of the Barbary lions in the wild serves as a stark reminder of the consequences of human actions on the delicate balance of nature. The story of the Barbary lion stands as a poignant testament to the importance of conservation efforts to protect and preserve the incredible diversity of life on our planet.\n\ntweet\ndiscovery article"

    "text": "The Effect of Mandatory Masks on Autism in Children\n\nBut hopefully, this [mask mandate in schools] will be a temporary thing, temporary enough that it [masks] doesn’t have any lasting negative impact on them [children]. - Anthony Fauci, August 9 2021\n\n\nRecognition of Faces: An Approach to the Study of Autism\n\nTwo age groups of normal, autistic and subnormal children were tested for their ability to recognize the faces of peers from isolated facial features and inverted photographs. The normal and subnormal subjects found the upper regions of the face most helpful for identification, whereas the younger autistic children found the lower features more helpful. The older autistic children showed no specific reliance on any one area, but were found to have error scores as low as those of the younger autistic children on the recognition of lower parts and error scores as low as the; controls on recognizing upper portions. The results are discussed and are found to favour a hypothesis in which the autistic child’s familiarity with the mouth and/or eye areas is related to a cognitive deficit which affects the processing of both verbal and non-verbal interpersonal communication.\n\nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics Poster, Highlighting the Importance of Facial Expressions for Children\n\nThey later were swallowed by the narrative, and made a public statement that in-school masks does not affect children (hypocritical)\n\nVisual Impairment: Its Effect on Cognitive Development and Behavior\nInfants Deploy Selective Attention to the Mouth of a Talking Face when Learning Speech\n\nThe mechanisms underlying the acquisition of speech-production ability in human infancy are not well understood. We tracked 4–12-mo-old English-learning infants’ and adults’ eye gaze while they watched and listened to a female reciting a monologue either in their native (English) or nonnative (Spanish) language. We found that infants shifted their attention from the eyes to the mouth between 4 and 8 mo of age regardless of language and then began a shift back to the eyes at 12 mo in response to native but not nonnative speech. We posit that the first shift enables infants to gain access to redundant audiovisual speech cues that enable them to learn their native speech forms and that the second shift reflects growing native-language expertise that frees them to shift attention to the eyes to gain access to social cues. On this account, 12-mo-old infants do not shift attention to the eyes when exposed to nonnative speech because increasing native-language expertise and perceptual narrowing make it more difficult to process nonnative speech and require them to continue to access redundant audiovisual cues. Overall, the current findings demonstrate that the development of speech production capacity relies on changes in selective audiovisual attention and that this depends critically on early experience.\n\nUnderstanding the Impact of Face Masks on the Processing of Facial Identity, Emotion, Age, and Gender\n\nThis is not even about children in particular, but illustrates how it may be detremential to young people in a learning phase\nAbstract Result: The results revealed that masks hindered the perception of virtually all tested facial dimensions (i.e., emotion, gender, age, and identity), interfering with normal speed and accuracy of categorization. We also found that the unwarranted effects of masks were not due to holistic processes, because the Face Inversion Effect (FIE) was generally not larger with unmasked compared with masked faces. Moreover, we found that the impact of masks is not automatic and that under some contexts observers can control at least part of their detrimental effects.\n\nFace masks reduce emotion-recognition accuracy and perceived closeness\n\nAgain, this was on adults, because you wouldn’t be able to publish your findings in 2021 if you exposed what it does to children\n\n\nIMPORTANT\n\nEmotion comprehension between 3 and 11 years: Developmental periods and hierarchical organization\nDarwin’s Contributions of our Understanding of Emotional Expressions\nInfants deploy selective attention to the mouth of a talking face when learning speech\nPotential Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Communication and Language Skills in Children\nEffect of face mask and noise on word recognition by children and adults\n\nThis PDF was taken off the web! I am linking it through Wayback machine\n\nThe puzzle of Autism in the time of COVID-19 pandemic: “Light it up Blue”\n\n“… Barriers to essential services such as speech and occupational therapies, combined with loss of routine and predictability has widened the gap between needs and provided care. Parents, teachers and health care should aim to work collectively for a broadened approach that is child/parent centered to compensate for most of disrupted vital support and services”"

    "text": "mRNA Vaccine\n\nThe mRNA platform is brilliant. But it has a giant gaping flaw in it, which is; Any cell of yours that produces a foreign protein, will be targetted by your immune system and destroyed. You will create an autoimmune disorder. When it works. How do you keep it out of your heart. Not by coding it in a lipid nanoparticle. So, they had no way to deliver it safely to market. So then they had a pandemic, the emergency allowed them to do it. This technology, in my opinion, was at least 3 decades out from being usefully and safely deployed at all, if at all. They did not want to wait, this crisis gave them the opportunity not to wait. And now, they will blame the spike protein, we picked the wrong protein. When in actual fact there are 2 problems, the spike protein and the platform itself. - Brett Weinstein\n\n\nMyocarditis/Pericarditis\n\nDifferent virus vs vax myocarditis mechanisms isn’t just theory. Here’s why you’re correct in real life.\n\n\nTIMING\n\nVirus myocarditis As Offit said, SARS2 viral myocarditis most often manifests as post-viral myocarditis due to molecular mimicry.\n\nThis means a few to several weeks after covid infection (ie symptoms/viral load were already gone weeks or 1-2 months ago), there is Ab/T crossreactivity (mimicry) to self-antigens in heart cells.\nThis mechanism is most often mild, good prognosis.\nTo clarify, SARS2 viral fulminant myocarditis, which can occur in days to a week after covid infection, is very rare. Initial covid presentation with fulminant myocarditis is so rare and unusual, it’s a case report. Almost all SARS2 viral myocarditis is post-viral and mild.\n\nVax myocarditis Most often occurs days to 1 week after 2nd vax dose. Also occurs after 1st vax dose or booster.\n\nThis timing is atypical of mimicry. Rather, this timing is textbook for a primary or secondary direct immune cell attack on mRNA-transfected heart cells.\nOffit knows all this. He’s obviously pulling a “limited hangout”. Pfizer will copy what Offit says.\nIf politicians were honest, they’d ask if mechanisms are the same (mimicry) for both virus and vax myo, then why are the timing and severity distinctly different for virus vs vax myo?\n\n\nSerum Vax Spike\n\nCirculating Spike Protein Detected in Post–COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine Myocarditis\n\nThere’s a high correlation of vax spike found in serum (blood) of vax myocarditis. Vax controls showed no serum vax spike.\nImportantly, Ab/T immunoprofiling of vax myocarditis patients were indistinguishable from vax controls (ie no unusual autoantibodies or autoreactive T cells (no mimicry signs)).\nThis is more evidence that in vax myo, your immune cells are killing your own heart cells that look virus-infected.\nThere’s more vax myo mechanisms like inflammasome or apoptosis. But you said the main vax myo mechanism perfectly.”"

    "section": "The Cold Hard Facts, Part 1",
    "text": "The Cold Hard Facts, Part 1\nThe use of cold-water immersion has a long and rich history. The beneficial effects on human physiology have been recorded as far back as 3500BC @Wang Et Al., with the Edwin Smith Papyrus (the most ancient medical text known to date) making references to cold being used for therapeutic purposes. The Ancient Greeks utilized cold-water therapies, as recorded by Hippocrates in the fourth century BC. And even the Golden Age of Rome featured cold-water immersion as treatment for fever, advocated for by Roman Physician Claudius Galen in the second century AD @Allan Et Al.. It was only until recently, however, that modern science began to explore the underlying physiological processes behind the power of the cold.\n\nEnergy and Focus\nDeliberate cold exposure triggers a release of epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine (noradrenaline) into the bloodstream. These hormones are responsible for the fight-or-flight response, and can make us feel alert and/or agitated @Huberman. This is why many people feel more energized after a cold shower or a cold swim.\n\n\nMetabolism\nCold exposure has been shown to increase energy expenditure, which can lead to weight loss and improved body composition. It has been recommended as a healthy and sustainable alternative strategy for increasing energy expenditure @van Marken Lichtenbelt Et Al..\nA core aspect of cold exposure is the activation of brown adipose tissue (BAT). BAT is a type of fat tissue that is responsible for thermogenesis, or the production of heat. It is found in small amounts in adults, but is more abundant in children. It is also found in higher concentrations in people who are leaner. The activation of BAT is thought to be responsible for the increased energy expenditure that is observed after cold exposure @Huberman.\n\n\nImmune Health\nA study published in the Journal of Applied Physiology found that cold exposure “induced a leukocytosis and granulocytosis, an increase in natural killer cell count and activity, and a rise in circulating levels of interleukin-6.” @Brenner Et Al.. In other words, this means that cold exposure increases the number of white blood cells, which are responsible for fighting infection, and increases the activity of natural killer cells, which are responsible for destroying cancer cells. It also increases the production of interleukin-6, which is a cytokine that plays a role in the immune response.\nA fundamental aspect of cold exposure therapy is the subconcious respiratory response by the sympathetic nervous system. Upon cold immersion, you may find your breathing rate to increase, and your breaths to deepen. It was traditionally believed that the sympathetic nervous system and immune system could not be voluntarily influenced.\nIn 2011, however, the “Ice Man” Wim Hof participated in a study wherein he was injected with endotoxin, a treated form of E coli bacteria which triggers the same immune response. The study produced groundbreaking results, claiming that through the use of Hof’s breathing technique, he voluntarily and significantly increased his immune system response to the bacteria and completely avoided the flu-like symptoms displayed by healthy participants within the control group. In an attempt to discover if this result was reproducable or an anomoly of Wim Hof himself, a study published in the National Library of Medicine in 2014 replicated the methods with individuals who were trained on the breathing technique prior to the injection. It was again found that the breathing technique resulted in an immediate and profound decrease of pCO2 and bicarbonate, and an increase in pH, indicating acute respiratory alkalosis, which normalized quickly after cessation of the breathing techniques. In laymans terms, this means that humans could, through the use of breathing techniques, voluntarily increase immune system activity.\n\n\nMood\nCold exposure has been shown to increase the production of endorphins, such as dopmain, which are responsible for the “runner’s high” and other feelings of euphoria. It has also been shown to increase the production of serotonin, which is responsible for feelings of happiness and well-being. Increased dopamin release can last for as long as 6 hours after cold exposure, and increased serotonin release can last for as long as 24 hours after cold exposure @Ootsuka.\n\n\nCold Immersion, T-Cells, and NK Cells\nCold water immersion has been reported to increase the level of T-cells (specifically, peripheral T lymphocytes). This has been observed both (1) in the short term after a single treatment/swim, as well as (2) in a longer, sustained manner after a period of multiple treatments per week.\nT-cells, also known as T lymphocytes, are a type of white blood cell that are derived from bone marrow stem cells and mature in the thymus gland. They play an essential role in fighting off infection. With an ability to “recognize” and “remember” germs that they have seen before, they can quickly respond if they see that germ again.\nIn other studies, similar increases have been observed for NK (Natural killer) cells. NK cell activity has been observed to increase both briefly after a treatment and in a sustained manner following consistent and repeated immersions.\nNatural killer (NK) cells are a type of white blood cell that can quickly recognize and destroy infected or cancerous cells without prior exposure or activation. NK cells do not require prior exposure to antigens, which are proteins or other molecules that can trigger an immune response. Instead, they use a variety of receptors to detect abnormal cells and then release toxic substances to kill them.\n\n\nCold Immersion & Cancer\nAlthough the science is still developing, there is reason to believe cold water immersion may help prevent the risk of tumors and cancers.\nIn a study done on lab mice, a “somewhat reduced spontaneous incidence of tumors, especially sarcomas” was observed among the group of mice that endured repeated cold stress (cold swims). It has also been reported that Cold-inducible RNA binding protein (CIRP) may function as a tumor suppressor via suppressing proliferation. Finally, there’s been a clinical review performed by the National Institute of Health (NIH) exploring the cold’s ability to stimulate “anti-tumor immunity”, which concluded this area deserves “more research as a major target for cancer therapies.”\nWe look forward to the progression of this research.\n\n\nThe Role of the Breath\nWestern biomedical research is gradually discovering the significance of the way in which we breathe, in relation to the body and its many physiological processes. Among these discoveries are how deliberate breathing techniques can 1. increase our tolerance to extremely cold environments and 2. alter immune function in real time.\nLet me highlight the significance of these discoveries: For centuries, modern (Western) medicine considered these processes (circulatory system, immune system, sympathetic nervous system) autonomic or involuntary, meaning they are unable to be controlled consciously. Recent research has slipped this understanding upside down - essentially, deliberate breathing practice is a superpower.\nThere is incredible research on breathing methods/techniques beyond the scope of this article, spanning brain function, enlightened & hallucinogenic states, mood/emotion control, and more. We encourage you to explore it if you’re interested, and we hope to come back to the topic in a future article/series.\nThe first groundbreaking study was done on Wim “The Ice Man” Hof, himself. In 2011, researchers at Radboud University injected Wim Hof with endotoxin, a treated form of bacteria that triggers a general immune response, as Wim practiced his breathing technique. The results were astounding:\n\n…levels of inflammatory mediators in Hof’s blood were much lower. On average, Hof’s immune response was decreased by 50 percent compared to other healthy volunteers. In addition, hardly any flu-like symptoms were observed.\n\nAt first, this study was a target of skepticism. With a sample size of 1, it was unclear whether the results were reproducible or simply Wim Hof producing an outlier result as an individual. However, it was enough to encourage further exploration.\nIn 2014, a study published in the National Library of Medicine sought out to reproduce the 2011 results in average “healthy participants”. The intervention group was trained for just 10 minutes in Hof’s breathing technique, and then both groups were administered with the endotoxin.\n\nIn the intervention group, practicing the learned techniques resulted in intermittent respiratory alkalosis and hypoxia resulting in profoundly increased plasma epinephrine levels. In the intervention group, plasma levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 increased more rapidly after endotoxin administration, correlated strongly with preceding epinephrine levels, and were higher. Levels of proinflammatory mediators TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-8 were lower in the intervention group and correlated negatively with IL-10 levels. Finally, flu-like symptoms were lower in the intervention group.\n\nIn summary, the results were successfully reproduced, and the researchers concluded that it is possible to voluntarily activate the sympathetic nervous system and affect immune response through deliberate breathing technique.\nHof’s breathing technique shook the biomedical science industry again in 2018, this time after he showed humans can consciously enhance their ability to survive in extremely cold conditions (beyond what was previously thought possible). The study concluded that deliberate breathing technique resulted in “increased sympathetic innervation and glucose consumption in intercostal muscle, generating heat that dissipates to lung tissue and warms circulating blood in the pulmonary capillaries.”\n\n\nMethod\nThe optimal, and most studied, approach entails complete submersion in cold water from the neck down. To sit in water from the chest down, with arms outstretched, for instance, precludes full stimulation of the stress response mechanisms which yield many of the advantages discussed in the previous two sections of this series.\nLikewise, although cold showers have demonstrated efficacy, they have not been subjected to the same level of scrutiny as cold water immersion from the neck down. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that the most optimal results may be obtained through full immersion in cold water. In the event that access to a cold bath is unattainable, cold showers serve as a reasonable alternative.\n\n\nHow Cold is “Cold”?\nThe short answer to this question is: uncomfortable but safe. Discomfort means that the beneficial stress hormones discussed in part 1 are being released in your system, thus offering the corresponding benefits.\nIf you are getting started, you may find that water temperatures around 45 degrees Fahrenheit is enough to feel uncomfortable. Over time, you are likely to find your cold immersion routine becomes easier. If you want to progress, and continue to extract maximum benefit, you must be honest with yourself to recognize whether you are pushing yourself, and increase intensity (decrease temperature) as appropriate.\n\n\nHow Often/Long Should I be Cold?\nA study done by Scandinavian scientist Dr. Susanna Søeberg suggests the magic number is at least 11 minutes per week, total. This is the threshold needed to increase brown fat thermogenesis and metabolism. This could be done in various ways, such as spreading it out throughout the week or doing it all in one day.\n\n\nWhen Should I Get Cold?\nScience suggests that whether cold exposure is done in the morning or at night does not affect the health benefits discussed previously. However, I personally recommend doing your cold exposure first thing in the morning.\nThe reason why relates to internal body temperature and circadian rhythm. Your body is warm when it is awake, and cold when it is asleep. In fact, studies have shown your body temperature must decrease by 1.5 degrees in order to fall asleep.\nExposure to cold temperatures can cause your body to heat up afterwards, making it more difficult to fall asleep if done late at night. On the other hand, if performed early in the morning, cold exposure may boost your energy levels and start your day off on the right foot.\n\n\nThe Søeberg Principle\nThe Søeberg Principle, developed by Dr. Susana Søeberg, posits the following:\nTo enhance the metabolic effects of cold, force your body to reheat on its own\n\nEnd With Cold\n\nAdditionally, the act of shivering during or after cold exposure can further activate brown fat thermogenesis and release heat from muscles, resulting in heightened metabolic increases.\nTo increase shivering and optimize the metabolic benefits of cold exposure, individuals are advised to avoid huddling and wrapping their arms around themselves while in the cold or after exiting it. Likewise, entering a sauna after cold exposure, although relaxing, will limit the metabolic benefits of the cold.\nIf you want to go further, it is recommended to refrain from towel drying and instead allowing the body to naturally reheat and dry off. Admittedly, this is difficult, especially when it’s cold outside."

However, I personally recommend doing your cold exposure first thing in the morning.\nThe reason why relates to internal body temperature and circadian rhythm. Your body is warm when it is awake, and cold when it is asleep. In fact, studies have shown your body temperature must decrease by 1.5 degrees in order to fall asleep.\nExposure to cold temperatures can cause your body to heat up afterwards, making it more difficult to fall asleep if done late at night. On the other hand, if performed early in the morning, cold exposure may boost your energy levels and start your day off on the right foot.\n\n\nThe Søeberg Principle\nThe Søeberg Principle, developed by Dr. Susana Søeberg, posits the following:\nTo enhance the metabolic effects of cold, force your body to reheat on its own\n\nEnd With Cold\n\nAdditionally, the act of shivering during or after cold exposure can further activate brown fat thermogenesis and release heat from muscles, resulting in heightened metabolic increases.\nTo increase shivering and optimize the metabolic benefits of cold exposure, individuals are advised to avoid huddling and wrapping their arms around themselves while in the cold or after exiting it. Likewise, entering a sauna after cold exposure, although relaxing, will limit the metabolic benefits of the cold.\nIf you want to go further, it is recommended to refrain from towel drying and instead allowing the body to naturally reheat and dry off. Admittedly, this is difficult, especially when it’s cold outside."

Thus, olfactory enrichment may provide an effective and low-effort pathway to improved brain health."
