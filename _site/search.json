    "text": "How it worked\nAttacker had two accounts, let’s call them account A and account B.\n\nAttacker funds account A with $5 million of USDC, to be used as collateral for on-chain positions.\nAttacker then offered out (sold short) ~483 million MNGO tokens, trading at $0.038 at the time.\nAttacker then funds account B with $5 million USDC, and purchases those ~438 million MNGO at $0.0382\nAttacker then purchases MNGO on the Spot market, artificially increasing its price. The price of mango reached $0.91 (a 24x increase).\nAt this new inflated price, account B was in the money for ~ $423 million. He used this account value to take out a loan of $116 million consisting of several tokens.\nAfter the attack, the MNGO/USD spot market then traded down to $0.02, which put account A in the money. However, Mango protocol was effectively drained of all liquidity, so account A could not be paid out."

    "text": "Summary\nMango Markets were designed to give loans at a certain collateralization ratio (e.g. 400%), but they used the spot market as an oracle for “fair price” of the token. Thus, tokens with low liquidity could be easily manipulated such that the protocol believes “fair price” is multiples above what anyone would purchase the token at in free markets."

For example, one could use a 24hr rolling average price to determine “fair value” for lending, which would make the market manipulator’s attack much more difficult (must pump price for 24 hour rather than a few seconds)."

(Decline)\nLate 1940s, there was a new optimizing with the invention of a relatavistic perturbation theory, where the infinities could be absorbed into a redefinition of parameters like mass and charge of the electron. People thought this was sweeping problems under the rug, but it also may have been a way of selecting good theories (renormalizable theories).\nFor example, theere’s nothing in the symmetries of quantum electrodynamics which rules out putting a term in the field equations (or Lagrangian), which could make the magnetic moment of the electron anything you want. This would make the mass of the electron -1, which means the theory is not renormalizable, and thus shows invalid.\nLate 1960s and early 70s, the standard model came to fruition - this was the renaissance of Quantum Field theory. But there were still doubts whether this was a fundamental theory or an effective one.\nQuantum Field Theory & Einsteinian Physics may be low energy approximations of a more fundamental theory."

Xavier recently graduated from Florida Atlantic University, where she conducted research at the Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute using shotgun metagenomics to analyze the biosynthesis of marine natural products. She received her Bachelor of Science in molecular, cellular, and developmental biology from the University of Washington in Seattle and was awarded a Fulbright Fellowship to study the regulation of reactive oxygen species at the Czech Institute of Experimental Botany in Prague. Prior to her academic career, she served as a nuclear electrician in the U.S. Navy where she was decorated with multiple honors including the Humanitarian Ribbon for her relief efforts during Hurricane Katrina."

The Department of Defense (DoD) spokesperson, Susan Gough, stated that the AARO has not discovered any verifiable information to substantiate such claims.

    "text": "Notes\n\nAll-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO): The AARO is the Pentagon’s UFO office. It is currently unable to confirm or deny whether it has discovered any verifiable information to substantiate claims that any current or former U.S. programs have had possession or reverse-engineered materials from non-human intelligences or unknown origin.\nDepartment of Defense (DoD) Stance: The DoD spokesperson, Susan Gough, stated that the AARO has not discovered any verifiable information to substantiate such claims. However, she declined to comment further on whether the term “extraterrestrial” could extend to materials of unknown origin or non-human intelligences.\nAccess to Information: Gough confirmed that the AARO has not been denied access to any U.S. government program, past or present, during the course of its work. She also stated that the AARO may receive all UAP-related information, including any classified national security information involving military, intelligence, and intelligence-related activities, at all levels of classification regardless of any restrictive access controls, special access programs, or compartmented access programs.\nTitle 50 Authorities: Gough addressed the issue of Title 50 authorities, stating that such authorities are unrelated to the AARO’s ability to receive all UAP-related information through authorized disclosures.\nPublic Affairs Policies: Gough explained that it is DoD policy that all interactions with the news media at the Department level, including press queries, are coordinated with the Office of the Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs. She also noted that her portfolio includes UAP, AARO, and the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence & Security, as well as other issues and offices.\nWhistleblower Trust: The blog post mentions that the AARO, which currently reports to the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence & Security, is not trusted by numerous whistleblowers. The issue may stem from the AARO’s proximity to the OUSDI&S, which has previously been criticized for allegedly persecuting whistleblowers.\nConclusion: The blog post concludes by noting that the National Defense Authorization Act of 2023 means that the AARO should report directly to Deputy Secretary of Defense, Kathleen Hicks, and the Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence on all operational and security matters relating to the AARO. However, there is no indication that this has been implemented yet."

    "text": "mRNA Vaccine x Myocarditis/Pericarditis\n\nDifferent virus vs vax myocarditis mechanisms isn’t just theory. Here’s why you’re correct in real life.\n\nTIMING\n\nVirus myocarditis As Offit said, SARS2 viral myocarditis most often manifests as post-viral myocarditis due to molecular mimicry.\n\nThis means a few to several weeks after covid infection (ie symptoms/viral load were already gone weeks or 1-2 months ago), there is Ab/T crossreactivity (mimicry) to self-antigens in heart cells.\nThis mechanism is most often mild, good prognosis.\nTo clarify, SARS2 viral fulminant myocarditis, which can occur in days to a week after covid infection, is very rare. Initial covid presentation with fulminant myocarditis is so rare and unusual, it’s a case report. Almost all SARS2 viral myocarditis is post-viral and mild.\n\nVax myocarditis Most often occurs days to 1 week after 2nd vax dose. Also occurs after 1st vax dose or booster.\n\nThis timing is atypical of mimicry. Rather, this timing is textbook for a primary or secondary direct immune cell attack on mRNA-transfected heart cells.\nOffit knows all this. He’s obviously pulling a “limited hangout”. Pfizer will copy what Offit says.\nIf politicians were honest, they’d ask if mechanisms are the same (mimicry) for both virus and vax myo, then why are the timing and severity distinctly different for virus vs vax myo?\n\n\nSERUM VAX SPIKE\nThere’s a high correlation of vax spike found in serum (blood) of vax myocarditis. Vax controls showed no serum vax spike.\nImportantly, Ab/T immunoprofiling of vax myocarditis patients were indistinguishable from vax controls (ie no unusual autoantibodies or autoreactive T cells (no mimicry signs)).\nThis is more evidence that in vax myo, your immune cells are killing your own heart cells that look virus-infected.\nThere’s more vax myo mechanisms like inflammasome or apoptosis. But you said the main vax myo mechanism perfectly.”\nCirculating Spike Protein Detected in Post–COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine Myocarditis"
