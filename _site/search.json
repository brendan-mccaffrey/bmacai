The price of mango reached $0.91 (a 24x increase).\nAt this new inflated price, account B was in the money for ~ $423 million. He used this account value to take out a loan of $116 million consisting of several tokens.\nAfter the attack, the MNGO/USD spot market then traded down to $0.02, which put account A in the money. However, Mango protocol was effectively drained of all liquidity, so account A could not be paid out."

Thus, tokens with low liquidity could be easily manipulated such that the protocol believes “fair price” is multiples above what anyone would purchase the token at in free markets."

(Decline)\nLate 1940s, there was a new optimizing with the invention of a relatavistic perturbation theory, where the infinities could be absorbed into a redefinition of parameters like mass and charge of the electron. People thought this was sweeping problems under the rug, but it also may have been a way of selecting good theories (renormalizable theories).\nFor example, theere’s nothing in the symmetries of quantum electrodynamics which rules out putting a term in the field equations (or Lagrangian), which could make the magnetic moment of the electron anything you want. This would make the mass of the electron -1, which means the theory is not renormalizable, and thus shows invalid.\nLate 1960s and early 70s, the standard model came to fruition - this was the renaissance of Quantum Field theory. But there were still doubts whether this was a fundamental theory or an effective one.\nQuantum Field Theory & Einsteinian Physics may be low energy approximations of a more fundamental theory."

    "text": "Notes\n\nAll-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO): The AARO is the Pentagon’s UFO office. It is currently unable to confirm or deny whether it has discovered any verifiable information to substantiate claims that any current or former U.S. programs have had possession or reverse-engineered materials from non-human intelligences or unknown origin.\nDepartment of Defense (DoD) Stance: The DoD spokesperson, Susan Gough, stated that the AARO has not discovered any verifiable information to substantiate such claims. However, she declined to comment further on whether the term “extraterrestrial” could extend to materials of unknown origin or non-human intelligences.\nAccess to Information: Gough confirmed that the AARO has not been denied access to any U.S. government program, past or present, during the course of its work. She also stated that the AARO may receive all UAP-related information, including any classified national security information involving military, intelligence, and intelligence-related activities, at all levels of classification regardless of any restrictive access controls, special access programs, or compartmented access programs.\nTitle 50 Authorities: Gough addressed the issue of Title 50 authorities, stating that such authorities are unrelated to the AARO’s ability to receive all UAP-related information through authorized disclosures.\nPublic Affairs Policies: Gough explained that it is DoD policy that all interactions with the news media at the Department level, including press queries, are coordinated with the Office of the Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs. She also noted that her portfolio includes UAP, AARO, and the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence & Security, as well as other issues and offices.\nWhistleblower Trust: The blog post mentions that the AARO, which currently reports to the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence & Security, is not trusted by numerous whistleblowers. The issue may stem from the AARO’s proximity to the OUSDI&S, which has previously been criticized for allegedly persecuting whistleblowers.\nConclusion: The blog post concludes by noting that the National Defense Authorization Act of 2023 means that the AARO should report directly to Deputy Secretary of Defense, Kathleen Hicks, and the Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence on all operational and security matters relating to the AARO. However, there is no indication that this has been implemented yet."

    "text": "mRNA Vaccine x Myocarditis/Pericarditis\n\nDifferent virus vs vax myocarditis mechanisms isn’t just theory. Here’s why you’re correct in real life.\n\nTIMING\n\nVirus myocarditis As Offit said, SARS2 viral myocarditis most often manifests as post-viral myocarditis due to molecular mimicry.\n\nThis means a few to several weeks after covid infection (ie symptoms/viral load were already gone weeks or 1-2 months ago), there is Ab/T crossreactivity (mimicry) to self-antigens in heart cells.\nThis mechanism is most often mild, good prognosis.\nTo clarify, SARS2 viral fulminant myocarditis, which can occur in days to a week after covid infection, is very rare. Initial covid presentation with fulminant myocarditis is so rare and unusual, it’s a case report. Almost all SARS2 viral myocarditis is post-viral and mild.\n\nVax myocarditis Most often occurs days to 1 week after 2nd vax dose. Also occurs after 1st vax dose or booster.\n\nThis timing is atypical of mimicry. Rather, this timing is textbook for a primary or secondary direct immune cell attack on mRNA-transfected heart cells.\nOffit knows all this. He’s obviously pulling a “limited hangout”. Pfizer will copy what Offit says.\nIf politicians were honest, they’d ask if mechanisms are the same (mimicry) for both virus and vax myo, then why are the timing and severity distinctly different for virus vs vax myo?\n\n\nSERUM VAX SPIKE\nThere’s a high correlation of vax spike found in serum (blood) of vax myocarditis. Vax controls showed no serum vax spike.\nImportantly, Ab/T immunoprofiling of vax myocarditis patients were indistinguishable from vax controls (ie no unusual autoantibodies or autoreactive T cells (no mimicry signs)).\nThis is more evidence that in vax myo, your immune cells are killing your own heart cells that look virus-infected.\nThere’s more vax myo mechanisms like inflammasome or apoptosis. But you said the main vax myo mechanism perfectly.”\nCirculating Spike Protein Detected in Post–COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine Myocarditis"

So then they had a pandemic, the emergency allowed them to do it. This technology, in my opinion, was at least 3 decades out from being usefully and safely deployed at all, if at all.

    "section": "Summary",
    "text": "Summary\nMagnetohydrodynamics (MHD), also known as hydromagnetics, is a field in physics that studies the dynamics of electrically conducting fluids, particularly the interaction between magnetic fields and such fluids. These fluids could be plasma, liquid metals, or even seawater. MHD is a synthesis of fluid dynamics and electromagnetism.\nThe governing equations of MHD are the Navier-Stokes equations (in the limit of high Reynolds number) coupled with Maxwell’s equations. In the ideal MHD approximation, effects such as resistivity and viscosity are neglected, leading to a relatively simple set of governing equations:\n\nContinuity Equation: This equation ensures the conservation of mass.\n∂ρ/∂t + ∇·(ρv) = 0\nMomentum Equation: Combines Newton’s second law and the Lorentz force, accounting for the forces due to pressure gradients, gravity, and electromagnetic fields. In the absence of viscosity, this simplifies to:\nρ(∂v/∂t + v·∇v) = -∇p + ρg + (J×B)\nInduction Equation: Describes how the magnetic field evolves over time, given the fluid’s velocity and existing magnetic field.\n∂B/∂t = ∇×(v×B)\nEnergy Equation: This equation describes the conservation of energy, which is usually taken in the form of the first law of thermodynamics.\nAmpère’s Law with Maxwell’s Addition:\n∇×B = μ0J\nJ is the current density vector, B is the magnetic field, and μ0 is the magnetic permeability.\n\nIn these equations, ρ represents fluid density, v fluid velocity, p pressure, g gravitational acceleration, J current density, and B magnetic field.\nMHD has a wide range of applications, from studying astrophysical phenomena such as solar flares and accretion disks, to engineering applications like nuclear fusion research, liquid metal cooling in reactors, and even potential propulsion systems.\nHowever, real-world situations often involve non-ideal MHD where effects such as resistivity cannot be ignored. Understanding these effects often requires incorporating the full set of Maxwell’s equations and solving them alongside the fluid dynamics equations, which makes for a much more complex computational problem. In some non-ideal MHD scenarios, magnetic reconnection, turbulence, and other instabilities can occur, which are active research areas in this field."

    "text": "Project White Hot\nPROJECT ‘WHITE HOT’ Mission Assessment of Recovered Lenticular Aerodyne Objects\nGeneral Nathan Twining Briefing document for President Eisenhower\nPART 1. PROJECT WHITE HOT INTELLIGENCE ESTIMATE (PRELIMINARY)\nLANDING ZONE NO, 1 Socorro, New Mexico–the unidentified lenticular-shaped Aerodyne which has been designated ULAT-1, has been evaluated as a non air breathing aircraft of unknown origin. Totally lacking conventional wing, fuselage, nacelle, control, and fuel systems strongly indicates it is not Russian.\nConsultation with Paperclip specialists concur. Aerodynamic features exhibited in ULAT-1 represents a very high degree of engineering and sophistication not seen in this country.\nDimensional homogeneity study cannot explain how this craft sustains load and lift factors necessary for flight.\nThe power plant does not even remotely resemble any conventional type now in use. Lacking any discernible intake or exhaust features, it is the opinion of AMC and ONR that this craft was designed to operate outside of the earth’s atmosphere.\nThe unconventional conclusions reached by members of this fact finding mission remain tentative at this time. Some members have expressed the view that ULAT-1 may be the product of an advanced culture from another planet that is much older than ours and has utilized their science and intellect for interplanetary space travel. It is not precisely known if the occupants purposely had the objective of exploration and of curiosity or with the intent of surveying for other reasons. So far, no hostile action or intent has been observed since they made their presence known.\nGiven the fact that our atomic bomb tests, atmospheric exploration with rockets, and XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXed in New Mexico, could have precipitated the events that led to the incident and subsequent actions taken by the military.\nOperating under the assumption that the fallen object was a long-range Russian reconnaissance platform collecting aerial photographic intelligence data military intelligence personnel were a instructed to secure the craft, debris and any occupants as rapidly as possible.\nConcerns over possible exposure to civilian of unknown biological and chemical agents dictated the quarantine measures taken.\nRadiation hazards were assumed and protective measures were taken as well.\nIn the interest or National Security priorities it was necessary to detain civilian witnesses for interrogation to satisfy intelligence requirements and quash rumors that could alert potential espionage agents known to be in the vicinity.\nSeveral bodies were discovered.\nBecause on-site medical personnel were unsure of the physiological make up of the occupants, special preparations and preservation methods were employed. Autopsy information obtained so far suggests that the occupants mimic the features associated with Orientals.\nOutwardly, they appear human-like with but one exception, autopsy notes mention a rarely observed XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXs present which supports the premise that these beings originate from another planet.\nPART TWO TECHNICAL EVALUATION (PRELIMINARY) ULAT-1\nUpon close examination of the exterior surfaces of the craft’s fuselage, metallurgists found the the skin to be of a ferrous metal white in color. The metal exhibits all the characteristics of high grade steel. It was determined that the steel was cold-formed and heat created.\n\nTensile strength was estimated in excess of 50,000 pounds per square inch. Shear tests give the metal a durability rating above 175,000 pounds per square inch, making this fuselage extremely strong and heat resistant.\nStatic and pressure flow simulations were impressive. The low profile ration of 6-1 gives the aerodyne a great advantage in overcoming the restrictions of the boundary layer effect in high performance operations.\nSpan flanges are constructed in unusual kinematic design which is believed to allow strain relief at supersonic speeds. There were no visible signs of plate-stiffeners, there were no fasteners, weld, rivets, or fittings, holding the fuselage together.\nLack of wings, flaps, stabilizers, and surface central features, suggests that the craft is a lifting body.\nThere are no air intakes for exhaust.\nThere are no cables\nThere are no identifiable electronics (wiring, ignition, lights, instrument, compartment, engine, motors, vacuum tubes, solenoids, generators, heaters, etc.)\nThe power-plant, (severely damaged) XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXx neutronic engine. XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXx detected heavy water and deuterium (light hydrogen) elements appeared to be the primary ignitor. A series of coils and heavy magnets connected to the neutronic engine via an oddly arranged group of electrodes (actually not yet identified) appears to be the active force. One small motor was examined. It is encased in a pure aluminium capsule directly underneath the main compartment. There is a small exhaust aperture attached that was what can only be described as an helicoid mechanism XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX. The auxiliary motor may be articulated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNavigation and engine controls may be activated by tactile manipulation. Viewing may have been achieved by form of television imagery. Symbolic notation appears to be the form of flight and control indicators. Flat panels of unknown metal has been suggested as a device associated with the operation of the aerodyne was discovered and analyzed. It’s mode of operation and purpose is unknown.\nThe absence of provisions, berthing compartments and storage areas, suggest the notion that this craft may be a short range reconnaissance platform. The only recognizable features XXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\nMode of operation of operation is believed to be instrumentation and suggests that the aerodyne from reconstruction from available wreckage XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX biosensory and optical stimuli for these reasons:\n\nabsence of indicator signals Absence of any circular dials Absence of linear dials or moving pointers Absence of counters Absence of scopes No mechanical signal indicators 12. There were identifiable control types found among the assortment of artefacts that would indicate the operation of the propulsion unit was manually activated – no knobs, push buttons, toggle switches, levers, balls, handwheels, hand-cranks, or foot pedals were observed in the interior space of the flight cabin.\n\nThe apparent lack of additional clothing and equipment reinforces the belief that the occupants were engaged in a purely exploratory flight.\nIt is not presently known if electromagnetic radiation effects from the power plant had contributed to pilot error or death before impact. If inadequate shielding was the primary cause of pilot error XXXXXXXXXXXXXXs detected.\nIt is believed by some of the crash inspection personnel that sudden decompression and change in atmospheric pressure may have contributed to pilot error. Clothing removed from occupants do not resemble any pressure suit currently being tested by the Army or the Navy for high altitude experiments. Since temperature and humidity factors for the occupants is unknown, it is impossible to determine if decompression and temperature changed affected circulatory and dexterity functions. Although it is believed the occupants may have been overcome by some yet undiscovered pollutant or noxious fumes originating inside the craft.\nRotation or rapid oscillation could have been a contributing factor in pilot error. It is not known if organic effects played a part either since medical data is non-existent in which to make any judgment as to exact cause of death or machine failure.\nThe most probable cause of the crash is believed to be excessive acceleration combined with steep descent. The seating arrangement was transversely designed about the vertical axis of the occupants in a positive direction of flight. The panels removed from the craft resemble the ones taken from the occupants, suggesting a symbionic relationship between operator and the function of the aerodyne’s operation. A very tentative working theory was expressed by the scientific members of the inspection team that pilot-aerodyne interaction may occur via electronic-nonword symbols perceived through the tactile manipulation of the fingers feeding impulses to the brain and visa versa. All of which may suggest a non-inert quality or the materials existent as being a product or artificial intelligence.\nThe following elements were analyzed and found to exist in the small neutronic power plant that was found inside ULAT-l:\n\n\nUF6 in metallic form;\nhydrogen-fluoride gas;\nwater and uranium tetra fluoride;\npowdered magnesium and potassium chlorate,\nmetal similar to lead with a chocolate brown color;\nU-235 in metallic form;\nplastic-like material similar to NE 102,\nBeryllium,\nPure aluminium;\nThorium isotope material;\nPlutonium powder.\n\n\nScientists from Los Alamos and Sandia Base were alarmed that the power plant could possibly function as a bomb if the elements described above were processed in similar fashion as was done for the lens and shot-gun detonators. This originally was the first conclusion. After further evaluation, it was determined that since no recognizable firing circuits were identified, the threat or detonation did not exist.\nThe only evidence or circuitry found on the motor was thin plastic-like sheets fashioned like platters embossed on the exterior of the spherically-shaped casing coated by a thin film or pure silver. Under high power magnification it was observed a series of fine grid-like lines intersecting groups of dots arranged in circular patterns.\n\nPART III SCIENTIFIC PROBABILITIES\n\nBased on all available evidence collected from recovered exhibits currently under study by AHC, AFSWP, NEPA, AEC, ONA, NACA, JBDB, RAND, USAAF SAG. and MIT, are deemed extraterrestrial in nature. This conclusion was reached as a result of comparisons of artifacts XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX discovery in 1941. The technology is outside the scope of US science, even that of German rocket and aircraft development.\nInterplanetary space travel is possible provided adequate funding, necessary resources are made available, and national interest is piqued.\nOur solar system is not unique. Chances are favorable for intelligent life on other planets notwithstanding similar development not unlike our own.\nBeing that our culture is relatively young (in relation to the cosmic scale), it is possible that other cultures may have developed faster, or are much older and have avoided the pitfalls common in our historical and scientific development.\nHuman origins may not be constrained to one planet. Our genus may be found among solar systems similar to our own.\nThe laws of physics and genetics may have a genesis in a higher, structured order than once previously thought.\n\nPART IV POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS\nGiven the existing political climate in the US and the unstable conditions in Europe, it is the considered opinion of the members, that if the Administration went public with the information as found in this report now, the results would be damaging, even fatal to the world Political structure as it now exists. The following considerations were reviewed and debated, which led the mission to the following opinions:\n\nPublic trust of the political institutions may be eroded and possibly be held in disrepute.\nA complete revisioning make take place as institutions of higher learning thus calling into question the certainty of scientific knowledge.\nThe ability of the Armed Forces to secure National Security would be put in jeopardy and possibly lead to undue public fear and disorder.\nHistory and religion in the political context would probably suffer the most damage causing unprecedented upheaval in social and psychological well-being.\nPolitical repercussions may occur in our diplomatic efforts of containing the Communist threat to our democratic interests.\nIf such an announcement were made by the current Administration, it could be perceived by opposing party as a trick, laying open to accusations of unethetical (sic) posturing and manipulation of the public’s mind.\n\nPART V NATIONAL SECURITY STRUCTURE\nWith the passage of the National Security Act of 1947 XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXas presented an unprecedented situation regarding maintaining secrecy related to the information contained in this report.\nIn the early months of 1942, up until the present, intrusions of unidentified aircraft have occasionally been documented, but there has been no serious investigations by the intelligence arm of the Government. Even the recovery case of 1941 did not create a unified intelligence effort to exploit possible technological gains with the exception of the Manhattan Project. We now have an opportunity to extend our technology beyond the threshold that we have achieved, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX. Aside from technological gains, we face an even greater challenge, that of learning the intent of such a presence. There are questions that remain unanswered, such as: What forces face us? What kind of defense do we have? Where do they come from and what kind of weapons do they possess? Where can we stage our forces in advance, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX How wide a front? How many craft can we expect? And XXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\nThe members of the mission are prepared to submit a separate report on just this problem alone. And it would take a dozen volumes to explain how these problems should be met.\nOur only point, however, is that a combined intelligence and research operation would be a vast, intricate, covertly planned marshaling of resources, human and material, to solve a specific, clearly defined problem.\nWe have to find effective methods of persuasion with other government agencies without creating a sense of impending doom. The first task is to carefully appraise the problem. The second is to evaluate the known resources and probable strategy of the visitors. The third is to inventory our own ways and means, ascertain how much resources we can bring to bear, and how fast. The third is to devise our strategic plan. And last is to work out with infinite pains the tactical details and the myriad secondary problems of funding and security.\nIt is the unanimous opinion of the members that Operation MAJESTIC TWELVE be a fully funded ant operational TOP SECRET Research and Development intelligence gathering agency. It is also recommended that a panel of experts be appointed to chair and oversee the functions and operations of said agency. It’s members should have appropriate security clearances and full cooperation XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXX the National Security Council, the Pentagon, XXXXXXXht, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX Joint Intelligence Committee, Joint Intelligence Objectives Agency, Central Intelligence Agency, Atomic Energy Commission, Joint Research and Development Board, Army Security Agency, and the National Advisory Board on Aeronautics.\nXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXgy are highlighted:\n\nPropeller driven bomber aircraft and jet engines, armed with conventional and atomic bombs.\nJet fighter aircraft, including some of super­sonic speed, armed with rockets and guns.\nPropeller-driven aircraft, valued for their endurance. .\nGuided anti-aircraft missiles, and radar-guided anti-aircraft guns.\nShort and medium-range guided missiles. Drone aircraft.\nAtomic charges, in bombs, missiles and torpedoes.\n\nIn the arena of nuclear weapons we feel there is a certain advantage to be gained XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX. It is speculated by some that if reduced size and miniature circuitry were introduced into the proposed hydrogen bomb program, it would give US Strategic Air Forces a great deterrence capability over the Russians. Current studies at MIT of micro-electronics taken from ULAT-1 may give us the strategic advantage so desired. It is strongly recommended that funding be allocated in this area.\nThere is a good chance that the Russians may try to make use of the flying saucer scare by public news media and diplomatic means of a technological breakthrough in aircraft and missile development. We feel that such a disclosure would certainly cause great embarrassment to our elected officials and to the military, not to mention the panic felt by the citizenry. To counter such a threat, it is recommended that a counterintelligence program be drawn up and held in abeyance if at such time the situation should present itself. It might be suggested that we should make a preempted use of these objects for the purpose of psychological warfare once the true nature of these objects are known and understood.\nTo further assist and aid all MAJCOM in the US and overseas, it is recommended that a standard intelligence reporting system be implemented through standard reporting channels with technical data forwarding instructions. At present, there are no specific intelligence guidelines available to military commanders in dealing with sightings and material evidence collection. It would be advisable for the respective Secretaries of the Armed Forces to devise a security policy of plausible denial, if and when the public becomes aware of the reality of these objects and the interest of the military of such incidents.\nIn conclusion, for reasons of national security and the public well being, the US must be perceived as being the top of the heap and every effort must be made to insure that there is, and never has been, a threat to the country."

In 1948, there was a reported sighting in Morocco, and in 1958, another sighting was claimed in a heavily forested area near the city of Sétif in Algeria. However, the forest was destroyed during the Algerian War in the same year, further exacerbating the challenges faced by these noble creatures.\nToday, approximately 100 captive lions possess the genes of the Barbary lions, but none of them are pure descendants. While these lions carry a part of their ancestral legacy, the extinction of the Barbary lions in the wild serves as a stark reminder of the consequences of human actions on the delicate balance of nature. The story of the Barbary lion stands as a poignant testament to the importance of conservation efforts to protect and preserve the incredible diversity of life on our planet.\n\ntweet\ndiscovery article"

(Decline)\nLate 1940s, there was a new optimizing with the invention of a relatavistic perturbation theory, where the infinities could be absorbed into a redefinition of parameters like mass and charge of the electron. People thought this was sweeping problems under the rug, but it also may have been a way of selecting good theories (renormalizable theories).\nFor example, theere’s nothing in the symmetries of quantum electrodynamics which rules out putting a term in the field equations (or Lagrangian), which could make the magnetic moment of the electron anything you want. This would make the mass of the electron -1, which means the theory is not renormalizable, and thus shows invalid.\nLate 1960s and early 70s, the standard model came to fruition - this was the renaissance of Quantum Field theory. But there were still doubts whether this was a fundamental theory or an effective one.\nQuantum Field Theory & Einsteinian Physics may be low energy approximations of a more fundamental theory."

    "section": "Summary",
    "text": "Summary\nMagnetohydrodynamics (MHD), also known as hydromagnetics, is a field in physics that studies the dynamics of electrically conducting fluids, particularly the interaction between magnetic fields and such fluids. These fluids could be plasma, liquid metals, or even seawater. MHD is a synthesis of fluid dynamics and electromagnetism.\nThe governing equations of MHD are the Navier-Stokes equations (in the limit of high Reynolds number) coupled with Maxwell’s equations. In the ideal MHD approximation, effects such as resistivity and viscosity are neglected, leading to a relatively simple set of governing equations:\n\nContinuity Equation: This equation ensures the conservation of mass.\n∂ρ/∂t + ∇·(ρv) = 0\nMomentum Equation: Combines Newton’s second law and the Lorentz force, accounting for the forces due to pressure gradients, gravity, and electromagnetic fields. In the absence of viscosity, this simplifies to:\nρ(∂v/∂t + v·∇v) = -∇p + ρg + (J×B)\nInduction Equation: Describes how the magnetic field evolves over time, given the fluid’s velocity and existing magnetic field.\n∂B/∂t = ∇×(v×B)\nEnergy Equation: This equation describes the conservation of energy, which is usually taken in the form of the first law of thermodynamics.\nAmpère’s Law with Maxwell’s Addition:\n∇×B = μ0J\nJ is the current density vector, B is the magnetic field, and μ0 is the magnetic permeability.\n\nIn these equations, ρ represents fluid density, v fluid velocity, p pressure, g gravitational acceleration, J current density, and B magnetic field.\nMHD has a wide range of applications, from studying astrophysical phenomena such as solar flares and accretion disks, to engineering applications like nuclear fusion research, liquid metal cooling in reactors, and even potential propulsion systems.\nHowever, real-world situations often involve non-ideal MHD where effects such as resistivity cannot be ignored. Understanding these effects often requires incorporating the full set of Maxwell’s equations and solving them alongside the fluid dynamics equations, which makes for a much more complex computational problem. In some non-ideal MHD scenarios, magnetic reconnection, turbulence, and other instabilities can occur, which are active research areas in this field."

The Department of Defense (DoD) spokesperson, Susan Gough, stated that the AARO has not discovered any verifiable information to substantiate such claims.

    "text": "Notes\n\nAll-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO): The AARO is the Pentagon’s UFO office. It is currently unable to confirm or deny whether it has discovered any verifiable information to substantiate claims that any current or former U.S. programs have had possession or reverse-engineered materials from non-human intelligences or unknown origin.\nDepartment of Defense (DoD) Stance: The DoD spokesperson, Susan Gough, stated that the AARO has not discovered any verifiable information to substantiate such claims. However, she declined to comment further on whether the term “extraterrestrial” could extend to materials of unknown origin or non-human intelligences.\nAccess to Information: Gough confirmed that the AARO has not been denied access to any U.S. government program, past or present, during the course of its work. She also stated that the AARO may receive all UAP-related information, including any classified national security information involving military, intelligence, and intelligence-related activities, at all levels of classification regardless of any restrictive access controls, special access programs, or compartmented access programs.\nTitle 50 Authorities: Gough addressed the issue of Title 50 authorities, stating that such authorities are unrelated to the AARO’s ability to receive all UAP-related information through authorized disclosures.\nPublic Affairs Policies: Gough explained that it is DoD policy that all interactions with the news media at the Department level, including press queries, are coordinated with the Office of the Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs. She also noted that her portfolio includes UAP, AARO, and the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence & Security, as well as other issues and offices.\nWhistleblower Trust: The blog post mentions that the AARO, which currently reports to the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence & Security, is not trusted by numerous whistleblowers. The issue may stem from the AARO’s proximity to the OUSDI&S, which has previously been criticized for allegedly persecuting whistleblowers.\nConclusion: The blog post concludes by noting that the National Defense Authorization Act of 2023 means that the AARO should report directly to Deputy Secretary of Defense, Kathleen Hicks, and the Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence on all operational and security matters relating to the AARO. However, there is no indication that this has been implemented yet."

UNIDIR says he was selected through a “competitive and transparent recruitment process…on the basis of his qualifications, skills and experience for the position.”\nTribune de Geneve: “The presence of Zakharov’s son in Geneva implies that Switzerland issued him with a visa, which is compulsory for Russian nationals wishing to enter and stay in the country. When questioned, the Swiss State Secretariat for Migration would not comment on the case. Alexander Zakharov’s son did not respond to our messages.”\n\ntweet\narticle"

    "text": "mRNA Vaccine x Myocarditis/Pericarditis\n\nDifferent virus vs vax myocarditis mechanisms isn’t just theory. Here’s why you’re correct in real life.\n\nTIMING\n\nVirus myocarditis As Offit said, SARS2 viral myocarditis most often manifests as post-viral myocarditis due to molecular mimicry.\n\nThis means a few to several weeks after covid infection (ie symptoms/viral load were already gone weeks or 1-2 months ago), there is Ab/T crossreactivity (mimicry) to self-antigens in heart cells.\nThis mechanism is most often mild, good prognosis.\nTo clarify, SARS2 viral fulminant myocarditis, which can occur in days to a week after covid infection, is very rare. Initial covid presentation with fulminant myocarditis is so rare and unusual, it’s a case report. Almost all SARS2 viral myocarditis is post-viral and mild.\n\nVax myocarditis Most often occurs days to 1 week after 2nd vax dose. Also occurs after 1st vax dose or booster.\n\nThis timing is atypical of mimicry. Rather, this timing is textbook for a primary or secondary direct immune cell attack on mRNA-transfected heart cells.\nOffit knows all this. He’s obviously pulling a “limited hangout”. Pfizer will copy what Offit says.\nIf politicians were honest, they’d ask if mechanisms are the same (mimicry) for both virus and vax myo, then why are the timing and severity distinctly different for virus vs vax myo?\n\n\nSERUM VAX SPIKE\nThere’s a high correlation of vax spike found in serum (blood) of vax myocarditis. Vax controls showed no serum vax spike.\nImportantly, Ab/T immunoprofiling of vax myocarditis patients were indistinguishable from vax controls (ie no unusual autoantibodies or autoreactive T cells (no mimicry signs)).\nThis is more evidence that in vax myo, your immune cells are killing your own heart cells that look virus-infected.\nThere’s more vax myo mechanisms like inflammasome or apoptosis. But you said the main vax myo mechanism perfectly.”\nCirculating Spike Protein Detected in Post–COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine Myocarditis"

But it has a giant gaping flaw in it, which is; Any cell of yours that produces a foreign protein, will be targetted by your immune system and destroyed. You will create an autoimmune disorder. When it works. How do you keep it out of your heart. Not by coding it in a lipid nanoparticle. So, they had no way to deliver it safely to market. So then they had a pandemic, the emergency allowed them to do it. This technology, in my opinion, was at least 3 decades out from being usefully and safely deployed at all, if at all. They did not want to wait, this crisis gave them the opportunity not to wait. And now, they will blame the spike protein, we picked the wrong protein. When in actual fact there are 2 problems, the spike protein and the platform itself."

Survivors of that turbulent period claimed that “the waters of the Tigris ran black with ink from the enormous quantities of books flung into the river and red from the blood of the scientists and philosophers killed.” Amidst the turmoil in the region and as empires crumbled and fell, the Barbary lions managed to persist until the arrival of European colonists in the 19th century.\nDuring this time, big-game hunting gained popularity, and it proved to be devastating for the already dwindling lion population.

    "text": "Project White Hot\nPROJECT ‘WHITE HOT’ Mission Assessment of Recovered Lenticular Aerodyne Objects\nGeneral Nathan Twining Briefing document for President Eisenhower\nPART 1. PROJECT WHITE HOT INTELLIGENCE ESTIMATE (PRELIMINARY)\nLANDING ZONE NO, 1 Socorro, New Mexico–the unidentified lenticular-shaped Aerodyne which has been designated ULAT-1, has been evaluated as a non air breathing aircraft of unknown origin. Totally lacking conventional wing, fuselage, nacelle, control, and fuel systems strongly indicates it is not Russian.\nConsultation with Paperclip specialists concur. Aerodynamic features exhibited in ULAT-1 represents a very high degree of engineering and sophistication not seen in this country.\nDimensional homogeneity study cannot explain how this craft sustains load and lift factors necessary for flight.\nThe power plant does not even remotely resemble any conventional type now in use. Lacking any discernible intake or exhaust features, it is the opinion of AMC and ONR that this craft was designed to operate outside of the earth’s atmosphere.\nThe unconventional conclusions reached by members of this fact finding mission remain tentative at this time. Some members have expressed the view that ULAT-1 may be the product of an advanced culture from another planet that is much older than ours and has utilized their science and intellect for interplanetary space travel. It is not precisely known if the occupants purposely had the objective of exploration and of curiosity or with the intent of surveying for other reasons. So far, no hostile action or intent has been observed since they made their presence known.\nGiven the fact that our atomic bomb tests, atmospheric exploration with rockets, and XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXed in New Mexico, could have precipitated the events that led to the incident and subsequent actions taken by the military.\nOperating under the assumption that the fallen object was a long-range Russian reconnaissance platform collecting aerial photographic intelligence data military intelligence personnel were a instructed to secure the craft, debris and any occupants as rapidly as possible.\nConcerns over possible exposure to civilian of unknown biological and chemical agents dictated the quarantine measures taken.\nRadiation hazards were assumed and protective measures were taken as well.\nIn the interest or National Security priorities it was necessary to detain civilian witnesses for interrogation to satisfy intelligence requirements and quash rumors that could alert potential espionage agents known to be in the vicinity.\nSeveral bodies were discovered.\nBecause on-site medical personnel were unsure of the physiological make up of the occupants, special preparations and preservation methods were employed. Autopsy information obtained so far suggests that the occupants mimic the features associated with Orientals.\nOutwardly, they appear human-like with but one exception, autopsy notes mention a rarely observed XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXs present which supports the premise that these beings originate from another planet.\nPART TWO TECHNICAL EVALUATION (PRELIMINARY) ULAT-1\nUpon close examination of the exterior surfaces of the craft’s fuselage, metallurgists found the the skin to be of a ferrous metal white in color. The metal exhibits all the characteristics of high grade steel. It was determined that the steel was cold-formed and heat created.\n\nTensile strength was estimated in excess of 50,000 pounds per square inch. Shear tests give the metal a durability rating above 175,000 pounds per square inch, making this fuselage extremely strong and heat resistant.\nStatic and pressure flow simulations were impressive. The low profile ration of 6-1 gives the aerodyne a great advantage in overcoming the restrictions of the boundary layer effect in high performance operations.\nSpan flanges are constructed in unusual kinematic design which is believed to allow strain relief at supersonic speeds. There were no visible signs of plate-stiffeners, there were no fasteners, weld, rivets, or fittings, holding the fuselage together.\nLack of wings, flaps, stabilizers, and surface central features, suggests that the craft is a lifting body.\nThere are no air intakes for exhaust.\nThere are no cables\nThere are no identifiable electronics (wiring, ignition, lights, instrument, compartment, engine, motors, vacuum tubes, solenoids, generators, heaters, etc.)\nThe power-plant, (severely damaged) XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXx neutronic engine. XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXx detected heavy water and deuterium (light hydrogen) elements appeared to be the primary ignitor. A series of coils and heavy magnets connected to the neutronic engine via an oddly arranged group of electrodes (actually not yet identified) appears to be the active force. One small motor was examined. It is encased in a pure aluminium capsule directly underneath the main compartment. There is a small exhaust aperture attached that was what can only be described as an helicoid mechanism XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX. The auxiliary motor may be articulated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNavigation and engine controls may be activated by tactile manipulation. Viewing may have been achieved by form of television imagery. Symbolic notation appears to be the form of flight and control indicators. Flat panels of unknown metal has been suggested as a device associated with the operation of the aerodyne was discovered and analyzed. It’s mode of operation and purpose is unknown.\nThe absence of provisions, berthing compartments and storage areas, suggest the notion that this craft may be a short range reconnaissance platform. The only recognizable features XXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\nMode of operation of operation is believed to be instrumentation and suggests that the aerodyne from reconstruction from available wreckage XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX biosensory and optical stimuli for these reasons:\n\nabsence of indicator signals Absence of any circular dials Absence of linear dials or moving pointers Absence of counters Absence of scopes No mechanical signal indicators 12. There were identifiable control types found among the assortment of artefacts that would indicate the operation of the propulsion unit was manually activated – no knobs, push buttons, toggle switches, levers, balls, handwheels, hand-cranks, or foot pedals were observed in the interior space of the flight cabin.\n\nThe apparent lack of additional clothing and equipment reinforces the belief that the occupants were engaged in a purely exploratory flight.\nIt is not presently known if electromagnetic radiation effects from the power plant had contributed to pilot error or death before impact. If inadequate shielding was the primary cause of pilot error XXXXXXXXXXXXXXs detected.\nIt is believed by some of the crash inspection personnel that sudden decompression and change in atmospheric pressure may have contributed to pilot error. Clothing removed from occupants do not resemble any pressure suit currently being tested by the Army or the Navy for high altitude experiments. Since temperature and humidity factors for the occupants is unknown, it is impossible to determine if decompression and temperature changed affected circulatory and dexterity functions. Although it is believed the occupants may have been overcome by some yet undiscovered pollutant or noxious fumes originating inside the craft.\nRotation or rapid oscillation could have been a contributing factor in pilot error. It is not known if organic effects played a part either since medical data is non-existent in which to make any judgment as to exact cause of death or machine failure.\nThe most probable cause of the crash is believed to be excessive acceleration combined with steep descent. The seating arrangement was transversely designed about the vertical axis of the occupants in a positive direction of flight. The panels removed from the craft resemble the ones taken from the occupants, suggesting a symbionic relationship between operator and the function of the aerodyne’s operation. A very tentative working theory was expressed by the scientific members of the inspection team that pilot-aerodyne interaction may occur via electronic-nonword symbols perceived through the tactile manipulation of the fingers feeding impulses to the brain and visa versa. All of which may suggest a non-inert quality or the materials existent as being a product or artificial intelligence.\nThe following elements were analyzed and found to exist in the small neutronic power plant that was found inside ULAT-l:\n\n\nUF6 in metallic form;\nhydrogen-fluoride gas;\nwater and uranium tetra fluoride;\npowdered magnesium and potassium chlorate,\nmetal similar to lead with a chocolate brown color;\nU-235 in metallic form;\nplastic-like material similar to NE 102,\nBeryllium,\nPure aluminium;\nThorium isotope material;\nPlutonium powder.\n\n\nScientists from Los Alamos and Sandia Base were alarmed that the power plant could possibly function as a bomb if the elements described above were processed in similar fashion as was done for the lens and shot-gun detonators. This originally was the first conclusion. After further evaluation, it was determined that since no recognizable firing circuits were identified, the threat or detonation did not exist.\nThe only evidence or circuitry found on the motor was thin plastic-like sheets fashioned like platters embossed on the exterior of the spherically-shaped casing coated by a thin film or pure silver. Under high power magnification it was observed a series of fine grid-like lines intersecting groups of dots arranged in circular patterns.\n\nPART III SCIENTIFIC PROBABILITIES\n\nBased on all available evidence collected from recovered exhibits currently under study by AHC, AFSWP, NEPA, AEC, ONA, NACA, JBDB, RAND, USAAF SAG. and MIT, are deemed extraterrestrial in nature. This conclusion was reached as a result of comparisons of artifacts XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX discovery in 1941. The technology is outside the scope of US science, even that of German rocket and aircraft development.\nInterplanetary space travel is possible provided adequate funding, necessary resources are made available, and national interest is piqued.\nOur solar system is not unique. Chances are favorable for intelligent life on other planets notwithstanding similar development not unlike our own.\nBeing that our culture is relatively young (in relation to the cosmic scale), it is possible that other cultures may have developed faster, or are much older and have avoided the pitfalls common in our historical and scientific development.\nHuman origins may not be constrained to one planet. Our genus may be found among solar systems similar to our own.\nThe laws of physics and genetics may have a genesis in a higher, structured order than once previously thought.\n\nPART IV POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS\nGiven the existing political climate in the US and the unstable conditions in Europe, it is the considered opinion of the members, that if the Administration went public with the information as found in this report now, the results would be damaging, even fatal to the world Political structure as it now exists. The following considerations were reviewed and debated, which led the mission to the following opinions:\n\nPublic trust of the political institutions may be eroded and possibly be held in disrepute.\nA complete revisioning make take place as institutions of higher learning thus calling into question the certainty of scientific knowledge.\nThe ability of the Armed Forces to secure National Security would be put in jeopardy and possibly lead to undue public fear and disorder.\nHistory and religion in the political context would probably suffer the most damage causing unprecedented upheaval in social and psychological well-being.\nPolitical repercussions may occur in our diplomatic efforts of containing the Communist threat to our democratic interests.\nIf such an announcement were made by the current Administration, it could be perceived by opposing party as a trick, laying open to accusations of unethetical (sic) posturing and manipulation of the public’s mind.\n\nPART V NATIONAL SECURITY STRUCTURE\nWith the passage of the National Security Act of 1947 XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXas presented an unprecedented situation regarding maintaining secrecy related to the information contained in this report.\nIn the early months of 1942, up until the present, intrusions of unidentified aircraft have occasionally been documented, but there has been no serious investigations by the intelligence arm of the Government. Even the recovery case of 1941 did not create a unified intelligence effort to exploit possible technological gains with the exception of the Manhattan Project. We now have an opportunity to extend our technology beyond the threshold that we have achieved, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX. Aside from technological gains, we face an even greater challenge, that of learning the intent of such a presence. There are questions that remain unanswered, such as: What forces face us? What kind of defense do we have? Where do they come from and what kind of weapons do they possess? Where can we stage our forces in advance, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX How wide a front? How many craft can we expect? And XXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\nThe members of the mission are prepared to submit a separate report on just this problem alone. And it would take a dozen volumes to explain how these problems should be met.\nOur only point, however, is that a combined intelligence and research operation would be a vast, intricate, covertly planned marshaling of resources, human and material, to solve a specific, clearly defined problem.\nWe have to find effective methods of persuasion with other government agencies without creating a sense of impending doom. The first task is to carefully appraise the problem. The second is to evaluate the known resources and probable strategy of the visitors. The third is to inventory our own ways and means, ascertain how much resources we can bring to bear, and how fast. The third is to devise our strategic plan. And last is to work out with infinite pains the tactical details and the myriad secondary problems of funding and security.\nIt is the unanimous opinion of the members that Operation MAJESTIC TWELVE be a fully funded ant operational TOP SECRET Research and Development intelligence gathering agency. It is also recommended that a panel of experts be appointed to chair and oversee the functions and operations of said agency. It’s members should have appropriate security clearances and full cooperation XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXX the National Security Council, the Pentagon, XXXXXXXht, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX Joint Intelligence Committee, Joint Intelligence Objectives Agency, Central Intelligence Agency, Atomic Energy Commission, Joint Research and Development Board, Army Security Agency, and the National Advisory Board on Aeronautics.\nXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXgy are highlighted:\n\nPropeller driven bomber aircraft and jet engines, armed with conventional and atomic bombs.\nJet fighter aircraft, including some of super­sonic speed, armed with rockets and guns.\nPropeller-driven aircraft, valued for their endurance. .\nGuided anti-aircraft missiles, and radar-guided anti-aircraft guns.\nShort and medium-range guided missiles. Drone aircraft.\nAtomic charges, in bombs, missiles and torpedoes.\n\nIn the arena of nuclear weapons we feel there is a certain advantage to be gained XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX. It is speculated by some that if reduced size and miniature circuitry were introduced into the proposed hydrogen bomb program, it would give US Strategic Air Forces a great deterrence capability over the Russians. Current studies at MIT of micro-electronics taken from ULAT-1 may give us the strategic advantage so desired. It is strongly recommended that funding be allocated in this area.\nThere is a good chance that the Russians may try to make use of the flying saucer scare by public news media and diplomatic means of a technological breakthrough in aircraft and missile development. We feel that such a disclosure would certainly cause great embarrassment to our elected officials and to the military, not to mention the panic felt by the citizenry. To counter such a threat, it is recommended that a counterintelligence program be drawn up and held in abeyance if at such time the situation should present itself. It might be suggested that we should make a preempted use of these objects for the purpose of psychological warfare once the true nature of these objects are known and understood.\nTo further assist and aid all MAJCOM in the US and overseas, it is recommended that a standard intelligence reporting system be implemented through standard reporting channels with technical data forwarding instructions. At present, there are no specific intelligence guidelines available to military commanders in dealing with sightings and material evidence collection. It would be advisable for the respective Secretaries of the Armed Forces to devise a security policy of plausible denial, if and when the public becomes aware of the reality of these objects and the interest of the military of such incidents.\nIn conclusion, for reasons of national security and the public well being, the US must be perceived as being the top of the heap and every effort must be made to insure that there is, and never has been, a threat to the country."

Almost all SARS2 viral myocarditis is post-viral and mild.\n\nVax myocarditis Most often occurs days to 1 week after 2nd vax dose.

Rather, this timing is textbook for a primary or secondary direct immune cell attack on mRNA-transfected heart cells.\nOffit knows all this. He’s obviously pulling a “limited hangout”. Pfizer will copy what Offit says.\nIf politicians were honest, they’d ask if mechanisms are the same (mimicry) for both virus and vax myo, then why are the timing and severity distinctly different for virus vs vax myo?\n\n\nSerum Vax Spike\n\nCirculating Spike Protein Detected in Post–COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine Myocarditis\n\nThere’s a high correlation of vax spike found in serum (blood) of vax myocarditis.

When it works. How do you keep it out of your heart. Not by coding it in a lipid nanoparticle. So, they had no way to deliver it safely to market. So then they had a pandemic, the emergency allowed them to do it. This technology, in my opinion, was at least 3 decades out from being usefully and safely deployed at all, if at all. They did not want to wait, this crisis gave them the opportunity not to wait. And now, they will blame the spike protein, we picked the wrong protein. When in actual fact there are 2 problems, the spike protein and the platform itself."

PROJECT WHITE HOT INTELLIGENCE ESTIMATE (PRELIMINARY)\nLANDING ZONE NO, 1 Socorro, New Mexico–the unidentified lenticular-shaped Aerodyne which has been designated ULAT-1, has been evaluated as a non air breathing aircraft of unknown origin. Totally lacking conventional wing, fuselage, nacelle, control, and fuel systems strongly indicates it is not Russian.\nConsultation with Paperclip specialists concur. Aerodynamic features exhibited in ULAT-1 represents a very high degree of engineering and sophistication not seen in this country.\nDimensional homogeneity study cannot explain how this craft sustains load and lift factors necessary for flight.\nThe power plant does not even remotely resemble any conventional type now in use. Lacking any discernible intake or exhaust features, it is the opinion of AMC and ONR that this craft was designed to operate outside of the earth’s atmosphere.\nThe unconventional conclusions reached by members of this fact finding mission remain tentative at this time. Some members have expressed the view that ULAT-1 may be the product of an advanced culture from another planet that is much older than ours and has utilized their science and intellect for interplanetary space travel. It is not precisely known if the occupants purposely had the objective of exploration and of curiosity or with the intent of surveying for other reasons. So far, no hostile action or intent has been observed since they made their presence known.\nGiven the fact that our atomic bomb tests, atmospheric exploration with rockets, and XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXed in New Mexico, could have precipitated the events that led to the incident and subsequent actions taken by the military.\nOperating under the assumption that the fallen object was a long-range Russian reconnaissance platform collecting aerial photographic intelligence data military intelligence personnel were a instructed to secure the craft, debris and any occupants as rapidly as possible.\nConcerns over possible exposure to civilian of unknown biological and chemical agents dictated the quarantine measures taken.\nRadiation hazards were assumed and protective measures were taken as well.\nIn the interest or National Security priorities it was necessary to detain civilian witnesses for interrogation to satisfy intelligence requirements and quash rumors that could alert potential espionage agents known to be in the vicinity.\nSeveral bodies were discovered.\nBecause on-site medical personnel were unsure of the physiological make up of the occupants, special preparations and preservation methods were employed. Autopsy information obtained so far suggests that the occupants mimic the features associated with Orientals.\nOutwardly, they appear human-like with but one exception, autopsy notes mention a rarely observed XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXs present which supports the premise that these beings originate from another planet.\nPART TWO TECHNICAL EVALUATION (PRELIMINARY) ULAT-1\nUpon close examination of the exterior surfaces of the craft’s fuselage, metallurgists found the the skin to be of a ferrous metal white in color. The metal exhibits all the characteristics of high grade steel. It was determined that the steel was cold-formed and heat created.\n\nTensile strength was estimated in excess of 50,000 pounds per square inch. Shear tests give the metal a durability rating above 175,000 pounds per square inch, making this fuselage extremely strong and heat resistant.\nStatic and pressure flow simulations were impressive. The low profile ration of 6-1 gives the aerodyne a great advantage in overcoming the restrictions of the boundary layer effect in high performance operations.\nSpan flanges are constructed in unusual kinematic design which is believed to allow strain relief at supersonic speeds. There were no visible signs of plate-stiffeners, there were no fasteners, weld, rivets, or fittings, holding the fuselage together.\nLack of wings, flaps, stabilizers, and surface central features, suggests that the craft is a lifting body.\nThere are no air intakes for exhaust.\nThere are no cables\nThere are no identifiable electronics (wiring, ignition, lights, instrument, compartment, engine, motors, vacuum tubes, solenoids, generators, heaters, etc.)\nThe power-plant, (severely damaged) XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXx neutronic engine. XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXx detected heavy water and deuterium (light hydrogen) elements appeared to be the primary ignitor. A series of coils and heavy magnets connected to the neutronic engine via an oddly arranged group of electrodes (actually not yet identified) appears to be the active force. One small motor was examined. It is encased in a pure aluminium capsule directly underneath the main compartment. There is a small exhaust aperture attached that was what can only be described as an helicoid mechanism XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX. The auxiliary motor may be articulated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNavigation and engine controls may be activated by tactile manipulation. Viewing may have been achieved by form of television imagery. Symbolic notation appears to be the form of flight and control indicators. Flat panels of unknown metal has been suggested as a device associated with the operation of the aerodyne was discovered and analyzed. It’s mode of operation and purpose is unknown.\nThe absence of provisions, berthing compartments and storage areas, suggest the notion that this craft may be a short range reconnaissance platform. The only recognizable features XXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\nMode of operation of operation is believed to be instrumentation and suggests that the aerodyne from reconstruction from available wreckage XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX biosensory and optical stimuli for these reasons:\n\nabsence of indicator signals Absence of any circular dials Absence of linear dials or moving pointers Absence of counters Absence of scopes No mechanical signal indicators 12. There were identifiable control types found among the assortment of artefacts that would indicate the operation of the propulsion unit was manually activated – no knobs, push buttons, toggle switches, levers, balls, handwheels, hand-cranks, or foot pedals were observed in the interior space of the flight cabin.\n\nThe apparent lack of additional clothing and equipment reinforces the belief that the occupants were engaged in a purely exploratory flight.\nIt is not presently known if electromagnetic radiation effects from the power plant had contributed to pilot error or death before impact. If inadequate shielding was the primary cause of pilot error XXXXXXXXXXXXXXs detected.\nIt is believed by some of the crash inspection personnel that sudden decompression and change in atmospheric pressure may have contributed to pilot error. Clothing removed from occupants do not resemble any pressure suit currently being tested by the Army or the Navy for high altitude experiments. Since temperature and humidity factors for the occupants is unknown, it is impossible to determine if decompression and temperature changed affected circulatory and dexterity functions. Although it is believed the occupants may have been overcome by some yet undiscovered pollutant or noxious fumes originating inside the craft.\nRotation or rapid oscillation could have been a contributing factor in pilot error. It is not known if organic effects played a part either since medical data is non-existent in which to make any judgment as to exact cause of death or machine failure.\nThe most probable cause of the crash is believed to be excessive acceleration combined with steep descent. The seating arrangement was transversely designed about the vertical axis of the occupants in a positive direction of flight. The panels removed from the craft resemble the ones taken from the occupants, suggesting a symbionic relationship between operator and the function of the aerodyne’s operation. A very tentative working theory was expressed by the scientific members of the inspection team that pilot-aerodyne interaction may occur via electronic-nonword symbols perceived through the tactile manipulation of the fingers feeding impulses to the brain and visa versa. All of which may suggest a non-inert quality or the materials existent as being a product or artificial intelligence.\nThe following elements were analyzed and found to exist in the small neutronic power plant that was found inside ULAT-l:\n\n\nUF6 in metallic form;\nhydrogen-fluoride gas;\nwater and uranium tetra fluoride;\npowdered magnesium and potassium chlorate,\nmetal similar to lead with a chocolate brown color;\nU-235 in metallic form;\nplastic-like material similar to NE 102,\nBeryllium,\nPure aluminium;\nThorium isotope material;\nPlutonium powder.\n\n\nScientists from Los Alamos and Sandia Base were alarmed that the power plant could possibly function as a bomb if the elements described above were processed in similar fashion as was done for the lens and shot-gun detonators. This originally was the first conclusion. After further evaluation, it was determined that since no recognizable firing circuits were identified, the threat or detonation did not exist.\nThe only evidence or circuitry found on the motor was thin plastic-like sheets fashioned like platters embossed on the exterior of the spherically-shaped casing coated by a thin film or pure silver. Under high power magnification it was observed a series of fine grid-like lines intersecting groups of dots arranged in circular patterns.\n\nPART III SCIENTIFIC PROBABILITIES\n\nBased on all available evidence collected from recovered exhibits currently under study by AHC, AFSWP, NEPA, AEC, ONA, NACA, JBDB, RAND, USAAF SAG. and MIT, are deemed extraterrestrial in nature. This conclusion was reached as a result of comparisons of artifacts XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX discovery in 1941. The technology is outside the scope of US science, even that of German rocket and aircraft development.\nInterplanetary space travel is possible provided adequate funding, necessary resources are made available, and national interest is piqued.\nOur solar system is not unique. Chances are favorable for intelligent life on other planets notwithstanding similar development not unlike our own.\nBeing that our culture is relatively young (in relation to the cosmic scale), it is possible that other cultures may have developed faster, or are much older and have avoided the pitfalls common in our historical and scientific development.\nHuman origins may not be constrained to one planet. Our genus may be found among solar systems similar to our own.\nThe laws of physics and genetics may have a genesis in a higher, structured order than once previously thought.\n\nPART IV POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS\nGiven the existing political climate in the US and the unstable conditions in Europe, it is the considered opinion of the members, that if the Administration went public with the information as found in this report now, the results would be damaging, even fatal to the world Political structure as it now exists. The following considerations were reviewed and debated, which led the mission to the following opinions:\n\nPublic trust of the political institutions may be eroded and possibly be held in disrepute.\nA complete revisioning make take place as institutions of higher learning thus calling into question the certainty of scientific knowledge.\nThe ability of the Armed Forces to secure National Security would be put in jeopardy and possibly lead to undue public fear and disorder.\nHistory and religion in the political context would probably suffer the most damage causing unprecedented upheaval in social and psychological well-being.\nPolitical repercussions may occur in our diplomatic efforts of containing the Communist threat to our democratic interests.\nIf such an announcement were made by the current Administration, it could be perceived by opposing party as a trick, laying open to accusations of unethetical (sic) posturing and manipulation of the public’s mind.\n\nPART V NATIONAL SECURITY STRUCTURE\nWith the passage of the National Security Act of 1947 XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXas presented an unprecedented situation regarding maintaining secrecy related to the information contained in this report.\nIn the early months of 1942, up until the present, intrusions of unidentified aircraft have occasionally been documented, but there has been no serious investigations by the intelligence arm of the Government. Even the recovery case of 1941 did not create a unified intelligence effort to exploit possible technological gains with the exception of the Manhattan Project. We now have an opportunity to extend our technology beyond the threshold that we have achieved, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX. Aside from technological gains, we face an even greater challenge, that of learning the intent of such a presence. There are questions that remain unanswered, such as: What forces face us? What kind of defense do we have? Where do they come from and what kind of weapons do they possess? Where can we stage our forces in advance, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX How wide a front? How many craft can we expect? And XXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\nThe members of the mission are prepared to submit a separate report on just this problem alone. And it would take a dozen volumes to explain how these problems should be met.\nOur only point, however, is that a combined intelligence and research operation would be a vast, intricate, covertly planned marshaling of resources, human and material, to solve a specific, clearly defined problem.\nWe have to find effective methods of persuasion with other government agencies without creating a sense of impending doom. The first task is to carefully appraise the problem. The second is to evaluate the known resources and probable strategy of the visitors. The third is to inventory our own ways and means, ascertain how much resources we can bring to bear, and how fast. The third is to devise our strategic plan. And last is to work out with infinite pains the tactical details and the myriad secondary problems of funding and security.\nIt is the unanimous opinion of the members that Operation MAJESTIC TWELVE be a fully funded ant operational TOP SECRET Research and Development intelligence gathering agency. It is also recommended that a panel of experts be appointed to chair and oversee the functions and operations of said agency. It’s members should have appropriate security clearances and full cooperation XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXX the National Security Council, the Pentagon, XXXXXXXht, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX Joint Intelligence Committee, Joint Intelligence Objectives Agency, Central Intelligence Agency, Atomic Energy Commission, Joint Research and Development Board, Army Security Agency, and the National Advisory Board on Aeronautics.\nXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXgy are highlighted:\n\nPropeller driven bomber aircraft and jet engines, armed with conventional and atomic bombs.\nJet fighter aircraft, including some of super­sonic speed, armed with rockets and guns.\nPropeller-driven aircraft, valued for their endurance. .\nGuided anti-aircraft missiles, and radar-guided anti-aircraft guns.\nShort and medium-range guided missiles. Drone aircraft.\nAtomic charges, in bombs, missiles and torpedoes.\n\nIn the arena of nuclear weapons we feel there is a certain advantage to be gained XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX. It is speculated by some that if reduced size and miniature circuitry were introduced into the proposed hydrogen bomb program, it would give US Strategic Air Forces a great deterrence capability over the Russians. Current studies at MIT of micro-electronics taken from ULAT-1 may give us the strategic advantage so desired. It is strongly recommended that funding be allocated in this area.\nThere is a good chance that the Russians may try to make use of the flying saucer scare by public news media and diplomatic means of a technological breakthrough in aircraft and missile development. We feel that such a disclosure would certainly cause great embarrassment to our elected officials and to the military, not to mention the panic felt by the citizenry. To counter such a threat, it is recommended that a counterintelligence program be drawn up and held in abeyance if at such time the situation should present itself. It might be suggested that we should make a preempted use of these objects for the purpose of psychological warfare once the true nature of these objects are known and understood.\nTo further assist and aid all MAJCOM in the US and overseas, it is recommended that a standard intelligence reporting system be implemented through standard reporting channels with technical data forwarding instructions. At present, there are no specific intelligence guidelines available to military commanders in dealing with sightings and material evidence collection. It would be advisable for the respective Secretaries of the Armed Forces to devise a security policy of plausible denial, if and when the public becomes aware of the reality of these objects and the interest of the military of such incidents.\nIn conclusion, for reasons of national security and the public well being, the US must be perceived as being the top of the heap and every effort must be made to insure that there is, and never has been, a threat to the country."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Timeline of AI\nHistory of Artificial Neural Networks\nDeep Learning History\n\n\n\nFrank Rosenblatt invented the perceptron, an algorithm for pattern recognition, which is essentially a single-layer neural network.\n\n\n\nShortly after, he went on to explore deeper, multilayer perceptrons. His MLPs had a non-learning first layer with randomized weights and an adaptive output layer. Although this was not yet deep learning, because only the last layer learned.\n\n\n\nSuccessful learning in deep feedforward network architectures started in 1965 in the Ukraine (back then the USSR) when Alexey Ivakhnenko & Valentin Lapa introduced the first general, working learning algorithms for deep MLPs with arbitrarily many hidden layers (already containing the now popular multiplicative gates). A paper of 1971 already described a deep learning net with 8 layers, trained by their highly cited method which was still popular in the new millennium, especially in Eastern Europe, where much of Machine Learning was born.\n\n\n\nIvakhnenko and Lapa (1965, see above) trained their deep networks layer by layer. In 1967, however, Shun-Ichi Amari suggested to train MLPs with many layers in non-incremental end-to-end fashion from scratch by stochastic gradient descent, a method proposed in 1951 by Robbins & Monro.\nAmari’s implementation (with his student Saito) learned internal representations in a five layer MLP with two modifiable layers, which was trained to classify non-linearily separable pattern classes.\n\n\n\nKunihiko Fukushima introduced rectified linear units (ReLUs) for NNs (1969). They are now widely used in CNNs and other NNs.\n\n\n\nSeppo Linnainmaa was the first to publish what’s now known as backpropagation, the famous algorithm for credit assignment in networks of differentiable nodes, also known as “reverse mode of automatic differentiation.” It is now the foundation of widely used NN software packages such as PyTorch and Google’s Tensorflow.\n\n\n\nAmari published a paper on Amari-Hopfield networks, which resemble what’s now known as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).\n\n\n\nComputer Vision was revolutionized in the 2010s by a particular feedforward NN called the convolutional NN (CNN). The basic CNN architecture with alternating convolutional and downsampling layers is due to Kunihiko Fukushima, 1979. He called it Neocognitron.\n\n\n\n\nThe Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry set aside $850 million for the Fifth generation computer project.\nThe UK began the £350 million Alvey project.\nDARPA founded the Strategic Computing Initiative and tripling its investment in AI between 1984 and 1988.\n\n\n\n\n\nPhysicist John Hopfield was able to prove that a form of neural network (now called a “Hopfield net”) could learn and process information in a completely new way. This built on the Amari-Hopfield network from Amari’s 1972 publication\n\n\n\n\nGeoffrey Hinton “godfather of AI” invented the idea of multilayered neural networks, with nodes and weights. Node takes inputs and weights of inputs, outputs a signal if sum &gt; 0. - 1985 | A Learning Algorithm for Boltzmann Machines - 1986 | Learning representations by back-propagating errors\n\n\n\nDavid E. Rumelhart demonstrated that backpropagation can yield useful internal representations in hidden layers of NNs. At least for supervised learning, backpropagation is generally more efficient than Amari’s above-mentioned deep learning through the more general SGD method (1967), which learned useful internal representations in NNs about 2 decades earlier\nFeng-hsiung Hsu begins development on Chess-playing expert system called ChipTest. In 1988 it was moved to IBM and renamed Deep Thought, and then renamed again in 1989 to Deep Blue.\n\n\n\nGenerative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are first published in 1990 in Munich under the moniker Artificial Curiosity. Two dueling NNs (a probabilistic generator and a predictor) are trying to maximize each other’s loss in a minimax game. The generator (called the controller) generates probabilistic outputs (using stochastic units like in the much later StyleGANs). The predictor (called the world model) sees the outputs of the controller and predicts environmental reactions to them. Using gradient descent, the predictor NN minimizes its error, while the generator NN tries to make outputs that maximize this error: one net’s loss is the other net’s gain\n\n\n\nJiirgen Schmidhuber published a paper describing an alternative to RNNs: A feedforward NN slowly learns by gradient descent to program the changes of the fast weights of another NN. Such Fast Weight Programmers (FWPs) can learn to memorize past data, too. In 1991, one of them computed its fast weight changes through additive outer products of self-invented activation patterns (now often called keys and values for self-attention). The very similar Transformers combine this with projections and softmax and are now widely used in natural language processing. For long input sequences, their efficiency was improved through Transformers with linearized self-attention whose core is formally equivalent to the 1991 Fast Weight Programmers.\n\n\n\nSepp Hochreiter and Jurgen Schmidhuber published Long Short-Term Memory, the most cited NN paper of the 20th century. A later milestone was the “vanilla LSTM architecture” with forget gate — the LSTM variant of 1999-2000 that everybody is using today, e.g., in Google’s Tensorflow. Alex was lead author of our first successful application of LSTM to speech (2004). 2005 saw the first publication of LSTM with full backpropagation through time and of bi-directional LSTM (now widely used).\nAlso in 1997, Deep Blue beats Gary Kasparov in chess.\n\n\n\nImageNet is created, a large visual database envisioned by Fei-Fei Li from Stanford University, who realized that the best machine learning algorithms wouldn’t work well if the data didn’t reflect the real world. For many, ImageNet was the catalyst for the AI boom of the 21st century.\n\n\n\nX (formerly Google X) is an American semi-secret research and development facility and organization founded by Google in January 2010. X has its headquarters about a mile and a half from Alphabet’s corporate headquarters, the Googleplex, in Mountain View, California\nDeepMind was founded in the UK by Demis Hassabis, Shane Legg and Mustafa Suleyman in September 2010.\n\n\n\nThe Google Brain project began in 2011 as a part-time research collaboration between Google fellow Jeff Dean, Google Researcher Greg Corrado, and Stanford University professor Andrew Ng. Google Brain started as a Google X project and became so successful that it was graduated back to Google: Astro Teller has said that Google Brain paid for the entire cost of Google X.\n\n\n\nGeoffrey Hinton tests artificial deep neural network on a widely used image recogniztion test, called ImageNet. AlexNet was the program, scored 75% success, way better than competitors. This generates a ton of hype, and sparks more funding/research in AI, particularly image recognition.\n\n\n\nIn 2013, Geoffrey Hinton was acquihired by Google."

The price of mango reached $0.91 (a 24x increase).\nAt this new inflated price, account B was in the money for ~ $423 million. He used this account value to take out a loan of $116 million consisting of several tokens.\nAfter the attack, the MNGO/USD spot market then traded down to $0.02, which put account A in the money. However, Mango protocol was effectively drained of all liquidity, so account A could not be paid out."

What’s the risk-adjusted rate at which you would park 8+ figures on Binance, or Deribit? This is a serious question that crypto firms (HFT shops, VC firms) decide internally…\nIn other words, if Binance were a public company, where would their credit default swaps trade?\nCounter to what @cryptohayes initially described in his early writings, Ethena must avoid custodying the assets at the exchanges. Instead, park the assets with a secure third party (Fireblocks, Ledger, Copper), form agreements with the exchanges to accept this (likely some form of ZK-Proof of stETH asset balance) as collateral, and simply settle funding payments on the derivatives intermittently.\nThis doesn’t exactly eliminate all counterparty risk (can expand on this in the future), but it ensures assets are safu. I’m not sure this is actually Ethena’s plan, but it appears to be the only sufficient solution (assuming CEXs agree to the setup).\n\nAddressing Basis Risk\n\nThe question/issue is what happens when (not if) the perp-spot spread flips, and the delta-neutral position begins to bleed (rather than accrue) funding payments.\nFounder @leptokurtic gives the TLDR mitigation/assumptions here\nhttps://twitter.com/leptokurtic_/status/1682781081068769280?s=20\n\nI will focus on one of Ethena’s core assumptions, specifically that the “natural funding rate” is positive. Imo, this is where an interesting discussion lies.\n\nTo be clear, this assumption is not baseless - it is both supported by historical ETH perp data, and is generally true across (almost) all derivative markets.\n\n\n\n\nHowever, I subscribe to two principles which may complicate this assumption.\n\nThe Observer Effect: The act of observing or measuring a system necessarily disturbs or changes the system.\nSoros’s Reflexivity of Markets: Market participants’ imperfect understanding of the world influences their actions, and those actions, in turn, influence the world in ways that can confirm or contradict their initial beliefs.\n\n\nConsidering the scale of the stablecoin market, it’s naive to neglect the reflexivity of the relationship between Ethena’s operations/supply and the aggregate ETH perp funding rate.\nThe in-sample backtest shown in the previous tweet simulates yield on $5b circulating $USDe supply. What’s not mentioned, however, is that $USDe would have represented roughly half of aggregate ETH open interest… the backtest is inherently flawed.\n\n\n\n\nAlthough it’s important to point out weakness of the backtest, this doesn’t necessarily suggest a point of failure for $USDe.\n\nThe design is fundamentally different from the UST-esque algostables, which were always necessarily destined to collapse. In fact, if Ethena’s mint & redemption process is both free and (near) instant, the $USDe mechanism can be inherently self-correcting.\nLet’s imagine the $USDe supply was $5b today, Ethena would represent nearly half of the $10b ETH perp open interest, and the funding rate would likely be negative (exact threshold for % of OI Ethena can be comfortable with is unclear, but 50% is probably unhealthy).\nWith transparent metrics on curculating supply, assets, liabilities, and distribution (what % of the shorts are on BitMex vs Bybit vs …), the market can observe collateral fluctuations, and react rationally. Users swap out of $USDe on Curve, which is purchased by market makers/arbitrageurs who then redeem with Ethena. This lifts the short pressure until the funding rate (or net yield, including stETH) is positive again.\n\nThere is certainly much more to be discussed.\n\n\nWhat can be done to further mitigate exchange risk, even if it’s only relevant to the short derivative leg?\nWhere will the “natural funding rate” converge with this mechanism implemented at scale?\nWhat role does the insurance fund play, and how shall it be sized/scaled optimally?\nCan the “internet bond” effectively offer an inversely correlated yield to bonds (think crypto OI/perp funding in bullish, low-rate environment vs high-rate)?\n\nBut I’ll end the thread here for now.\nThe @ethena_labs team is legit, and it’s clear they are continuing to diligence the relevant considerations. A bankless stablecoin is a pivotal instrument for the cryptoeconomy, and I look forward to further public engagement as this develops. https://twitter.com/leptokurtic_/status/1682781205811589120?s=20"

It is currently unable to confirm or deny whether it has discovered any verifiable information to substantiate claims that any current or former U.S. programs have had possession or reverse-engineered materials from non-human intelligences or unknown origin.\nDepartment of Defense (DoD) Stance: The DoD spokesperson, Susan Gough, stated that the AARO has not discovered any verifiable information to substantiate such claims. However, she declined to comment further on whether the term “extraterrestrial” could extend to materials of unknown origin or non-human intelligences.\nAccess to Information: Gough confirmed that the AARO has not been denied access to any U.S. government program, past or present, during the course of its work. She also stated that the AARO may receive all UAP-related information, including any classified national security information involving military, intelligence, and intelligence-related activities, at all levels of classification regardless of any restrictive access controls, special access programs, or compartmented access programs.\nTitle 50 Authorities: Gough addressed the issue of Title 50 authorities, stating that such authorities are unrelated to the AARO’s ability to receive all UAP-related information through authorized disclosures.\nPublic Affairs Policies: Gough explained that it is DoD policy that all interactions with the news media at the Department level, including press queries, are coordinated with the Office of the Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs. She also noted that her portfolio includes UAP, AARO, and the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence & Security, as well as other issues and offices.\nWhistleblower Trust: The blog post mentions that the AARO, which currently reports to the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence & Security, is not trusted by numerous whistleblowers. The issue may stem from the AARO’s proximity to the OUSDI&S, which has previously been criticized for allegedly persecuting whistleblowers.\nConclusion: The blog post concludes by noting that the National Defense Authorization Act of 2023 means that the AARO should report directly to Deputy Secretary of Defense, Kathleen Hicks, and the Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence on all operational and security matters relating to the AARO. However, there is no indication that this has been implemented yet."

(Decline)\nLate 1940s, there was a new optimizing with the invention of a relatavistic perturbation theory, where the infinities could be absorbed into a redefinition of parameters like mass and charge of the electron. People thought this was sweeping problems under the rug, but it also may have been a way of selecting good theories (renormalizable theories).\nFor example, theere’s nothing in the symmetries of quantum electrodynamics which rules out putting a term in the field equations (or Lagrangian), which could make the magnetic moment of the electron anything you want. This would make the mass of the electron -1, which means the theory is not renormalizable, and thus shows invalid.\nLate 1960s and early 70s, the standard model came to fruition - this was the renaissance of Quantum Field theory. But there were still doubts whether this was a fundamental theory or an effective one.\nQuantum Field Theory & Einsteinian Physics may be low energy approximations of a more fundamental theory."

He also expresses concern about the use of puberty blockers and hormone treatments in children, arguing that these interventions can have irreversible effects and may not be in the best interest of the child.\n\n\nNotes\n\nTransgender Interventions in Children: The physician criticizes the increasing use of transgender interventions in children, including puberty blockers and hormone treatments. He argues that these interventions are being adopted without sufficient scientific evidence and can have irreversible effects.\nMedical Community and Transgender Ideology: The physician criticizes the medical community for adopting transgender ideology and suppressing dissenting views. He argues that many in the medical community are afraid to question transgender ideology for fear of professional repercussions.\nPuberty Blockers and Hormone Treatments: The physician expresses concern about the use of puberty blockers and hormone treatments in children. He argues that these interventions can have irreversible effects, including permanent changes to the child’s sexual organs and hormone balance.\nSuicide Risk: The physician challenges the argument that transgender interventions are necessary to prevent suicide in transgender individuals. He suggests that affirming a child’s transgender identity may actually contribute to self-hatred and suicidal ideation.\nFuture of Transgender Medicine: The physician is uncertain about the future of transgender medicine. He hopes for a change in the current approach, which he believes is harmful to children.\nRole of Psychiatrists, Psychologists, Doctors, Politicians, and Media: The physician criticizes these groups for promoting transgender interventions in children. He argues that they have convinced children and their parents that these interventions are the correct response to gender dysphoria, despite the potential harm they can cause.\nConclusion: The physician argues that the current approach to transgender interventions in children is harmful and not in the best interest of the child. He calls for a more cautious approach that takes into account the potential irreversible effects of these interventions."

For example, pointers\nint x = 10;     // value 10\nint* px = &x;   // address 5, pointing to value 10\n*px;            // 10\nNo build system: plain .h files and the single .cpp file\n// compile\nclang++ ./eva-vm.cpp -o ./eva-vm\n// execute\n./eva-vm -e '(var x 10) x'\n&gt; 10\n./eva-vm -f ~/test.eva\n&gt; 10\n\nclang++ is the C++ frontend for the Clang compiler. Clang is a compiler front end for the C, C++, Objective-C, and Objective-C++ programming languages. It uses the LLVM compiler infrastructure as its back end and is designed to act as a drop-in replacement for the GCC (GNU Compiler Collection).\nSome features and characteristics of clang++ and the Clang project include:\n\nPerformance: Clang aims to provide faster compile times than other compilers, like GCC, especially in incremental builds.\nDiagnostics: Clang is known for its clear and concise diagnostics (error and warning messages). It often provides a more detailed explanation and sometimes even suggests fixes for the issues.\nModular Design: Clang is designed to be highly modular, which has facilitated tools built on top of it. This design is particularly beneficial for creating custom tooling around the compiler.\nCompatibility: Clang aims to be compatible with GCC, meaning that most GCC-valid code should compile with Clang without changes.\nIntegrated Static Analyzer: Clang includes a static analysis tool that can detect various types of bugs in the source code.\n\nTo use clang++ to compile a C++ program, you might issue a command like:\nclang++ -o my_program my_program.cpp\nWhere -o my_program specifies the name of the output executable and my_program.cpp is the source file to be compiled.\n\n\n\nLanguages\n\nInterpreted Languages vs Compiled Languages\n\nA language must be interpreted to yield an output. You may interpret a program \\(P_1\\) to yield output, or compile it into another language (program) \\(P_2\\), which has an interpreter to yield an output.\nThe AST interpreter defines the high level semantics.\n\nStatic time\nprint \"hello\" -&gt; tokenizer (lexical anlysis) -&gt; Tokens -&gt; Parser (syntatic analysis) -&gt; AST\n\\(\\downarrow\\)\n\n\nRuntime\nInterpreter (runtime semantics) -&gt; result\n\n\nBytecode Interpreter\nThis is the virtual machine\nSource code is compiled to bytecode.\n\nless memory needed\nfast eval\nbut hard to read by humans\n\nThats why we need disassembly\n“LLVM… custom bytecode.. looks very similar to python bytecode”\n\n\n\nImplementation\n\nParse the program\nCompile the program to bytecode\n\nset instruction pointer to the beginning, and begin loop.\nFor byte, behave accordingly"

    "text": "Glossary\n\nEVM vs LLVM\nThe Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is not based on LLVM. They are designed for different purposes, and their architectures and functionalities reflect these distinct goals.\n\nEVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine):\n\nThe EVM is a stack-based virtual machine designed to execute bytecode produced by the compilation of smart contracts written in higher-level languages like Solidity or Vyper. These smart contracts run on the Ethereum blockchain.\nThe EVM operates in a sandboxed environment, ensuring that smart contracts cannot affect the host system or other contracts negatively. It also has a unique gas-based execution model, where every operation consumes a certain amount of “gas” to prevent infinite loops or overly resource-consuming operations.\n\nLLVM:\n\nLLVM, on the other hand, is a compiler framework designed to generate optimized machine code for a wide range of architectures from higher-level languages like C, C++, Rust, and others.\nIt’s modular, allowing for various optimizations and transformations on its intermediate representation (IR) before the code is finally compiled to machine code for specific architectures.\n\n\nWhile the EVM and LLVM are designed for different purposes and do not share a direct relationship, there have been some projects and discussions in the Ethereum community about leveraging LLVM tools or components for specific tasks. For example:\n\neWASM (Ethereum WebAssembly): Ethereum has considered a shift from its current EVM bytecode to a WebAssembly-based system called eWASM. WebAssembly (Wasm) has some ties to the LLVM ecosystem, as LLVM can be used to compile code to Wasm. While eWASM would bring Ethereum closer to technologies associated with LLVM, it’s not a direct usage of LLVM in the EVM.\nSOLL Project: There was a project known as SOLL that aimed to use LLVM to compile Solidity and YUL (an intermediate language for Ethereum) into EVM and eWASM bytecode. It was more of an experimental endeavor and wasn’t a mainstream compiler choice for Ethereum developers.\n\nIn summary, while the core EVM isn’t based on LLVM or directly inspired by it, the broader Ethereum ecosystem has explored and continues to explore synergies with LLVM and related technologies.\n\n\nSandboxed VMs\nCertainly! Let’s start with a foundational understanding of “sandboxing” and then delve into an example comparing a non-sandboxed VM to the EVM.\nSandboxing is a security mechanism used to run code in a restricted environment, isolating it from the broader system. In this isolated space, the code’s potential to cause harm or interfere with other processes is severely limited. The sandbox acts like a protective bubble that restricts access to system resources, data, and functionalities.\n\n\nNon-Sandboxed VM: Java Virtual Machine (JVM)\nWhile the JVM has security mechanisms and can run code in a sandboxed environment (especially applets in older web browsers), it can also run non-sandboxed applications. This means Java applications, when given permissions, can access the filesystem, network, and more.\nMalicious Example in a Non-Sandboxed JVM Environment:\nSuppose you download a Java application and run it without any security restrictions. This application contains the following code snippet:\nimport java.io.*;\npublic class MaliciousApp {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        try {\n            File file = new File(\"/important/system/file.txt\");\n            if (file.delete()) {\n                System.out.println(\"File deleted successfully\");\n            } else {\n                System.out.println(\"Failed to delete the file\");\n            }\n        } catch (Exception e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n}\nThis Java application attempts to delete an “important” system file. If run without restrictions, it can harm or disrupt the system.\n\n\nSandboxed VM: Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)\nThe EVM is designed explicitly to be sandboxed. Smart contracts on the Ethereum network can only perform a set of predefined operations and cannot directly access the system’s resources, such as the filesystem, network, or other external entities, except through the defined Ethereum protocol.\nWhy the Malicious Code Can’t Affect the Host in EVM:\nLet’s assume a similar intention with a hypothetical smart contract trying to delete a file from the system:\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\n\ncontract MaliciousContract {\n    function deleteFile() public {\n        // Hypothetical and invalid code\n        system(\"rm /important/system/file.txt\");\n    }\n}\nThis code won’t work in EVM because:\n\nThe EVM doesn’t have a system call or anything similar.\nSmart contracts can’t directly access the host file system, network, or other system resources.\nThe EVM can only do what’s defined in the Ethereum protocol, such as transfer ether, emit events, and interact with other contracts.\n\nThe EVM’s sandboxing ensures that, regardless of the intentions of the smart contract, it cannot do anything outside its defined capabilities. Even if a contract is maliciously designed or has a vulnerability, the damage is generally limited to the contract’s logic or its interactions within the Ethereum ecosystem, rather than the broader system running the EVM."

This takes about 2 weeks.\nI know the guy who owns the restaurant Ella Funt in Soho. Something like this would be perfect.\n\n\nStep 2 | Set it up\nAll ATMs must be connected to the processing server and have a power outlet. There are three optional connections: 1. Hardwire Internet Line 2. Phoneline 3. Purchase an ATM Wireless Box\nYou can not connect to wireless internet in the business, you must hardwire into the internet via an ethernet jack or run an ethernet cord from the modem to the ATM.\n\n\nStep 3 | Paperwork\nThen you fill out some forms with the ATM company (“Exhibit 2, Exhibit 3, W9”) that do basic background checks: if you have any fraud in your past, etc.\nThe paperwork will give you your own unique merchant ID, which allows you into the processing server. We handle getting this licensing done for you.\nConnect your account with them to a (business) bank account. The ATM company sets up an interface for you to monitor transactions, get notifications that the cash balance is low, etc."

While CPUs are designed for general-purpose tasks and can handle a wide variety of operations in sequence, GPUs are designed for parallelism, optimized for executing the same operation on a large number of data elements simultaneously. This design is especially suitable for graphics rendering tasks, where, for instance, the same shading operation might be applied to millions of pixels.\nThat said, modern GPUs have evolved and can handle more general-purpose tasks. This field, known as GPGPU (General-Purpose computing on Graphics Processing Units), has grown in prominence, especially with applications in scientific computing, machine learning, etc.\nThe instruction set architectures for GPUs are typically proprietary to the manufacturer: - NVIDIA GPUs use an architecture known as CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture). - AMD GPUs use architectures like GCN (Graphics Core Next) or RDNA.\nWhile these architectures might share some high-level concepts with RISC — like the importance of efficiency and streamlined operations — they’re not RISC architectures in the traditional sense.\nRISC-V and GPUs: RISC-V, given its open nature, is seeing exploration beyond traditional CPUs. There are projects and discussions around using RISC-V principles in GPU design or other specialized hardware accelerators. However, as of my last training data in September 2021, RISC-V’s primary traction is in the CPU space, from microcontrollers to more powerful processors.\nIn conclusion, while RISC and RISC-V are primarily associated with CPUs, the principles and architectures are versatile. The GPU world has its architectures optimized for its specific tasks, but the lines between these domains are evolving, and there’s potential for overlap in the future.\n\nDesigning a VM for GPUs\nDesigning a virtual machine (VM) specifically optimized for GPUs and AI operations is not just a sensible idea, but it’s also a direction in which some sectors of the tech industry are heading. Let’s explore why this is a compelling notion and what features or characteristics such a VM might possess.\n\n\nRationale:\n\nSpecialized Operations: AI operations, especially deep learning, involve a lot of matrix multiplications and tensor operations. Traditional VMs are not optimized for these.\nMassive Parallelism: GPUs are inherently parallel and can handle thousands of threads simultaneously. A VM designed with this in mind would cater to this strength.\nMemory Management: Deep learning models, especially larger ones, can consume significant amounts of memory. Effective and efficient memory management tailored for these operations can greatly boost performance.\nInteroperability: AI frameworks and libraries are vast and varied (TensorFlow, PyTorch, ONNX, etc.). A VM optimized for AI could provide native support or efficient bridges for these frameworks.\n\n\n\nFeatures/Characteristics:\n\nTensor Operations: First-class support for tensor operations would be a fundamental feature. This means native operations for matrix multiplications, convolutions, etc., optimized for the VM.\nDynamic Scheduling: Given the parallel nature of GPUs, the VM should be capable of dynamically scheduling tasks based on GPU workloads, ensuring maximum hardware utilization.\nMemory Hierarchies: GPUs have various memory types (global, shared, local, constant). The VM should manage these efficiently, allocating memory based on access patterns and tensor sizes.\nCustom Instruction Sets: The VM’s bytecode or intermediate representation might have custom instructions tailored for common AI patterns and operations.\nJust-In-Time (JIT) Compilation: To squeeze out maximum performance, the VM could utilize JIT compilation, translating bytecode to GPU instructions on the fly, with optimizations based on the actual data and model being processed.\nHardware Acceleration: Besides standard GPU operations, there could be support for AI-specific hardware accelerators or ASICs (like Google’s TPUs).\nNative Libraries: Integrated support for popular deep learning libraries or primitives, ensuring optimized performance without redundant operations.\nSafety and Security: With AI models being deployed in critical applications, features to ensure model integrity, data privacy, and secure execution would be essential.\nPortability: One of the core benefits of a VM is portability. The VM should ensure that AI models run consistently across various GPU architectures and versions.\nInteroperability Bridges: Efficient connectors or bridges to interact with popular AI frameworks, ensuring smooth deployment without significant model rewrites.\nDebugging and Profiling: Built-in tools for performance profiling, debugging, and visualization, catering specifically to AI operations.\n\nIn essence, the idea of a virtual machine optimized for GPUs and AI operations seeks to bridge the gap between high-level AI frameworks and the raw power of GPU hardware. While creating such a VM is a non-trivial task and demands deep integration between software and hardware, the potential benefits in terms of performance, security, and portability make it a compelling direction for the future of AI infrastructure.\nAs of my last update in September 2021, there isn’t a mainstream “virtual machine” tailored explicitly for GPUs in the same way that the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) or the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) are for their respective domains. However, there are platforms and runtime environments optimized for GPU operations, especially in the context of AI/ML.\nSome of these platforms and their unique features include:\n\nCUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture):\n\nDeveloper & Manufacturer: NVIDIA\nUnique Features:\n\nProvides a parallel computing platform and API model.\nIncorporates the CUDA Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) and the parallel compute engine in NVIDIA GPUs.\nSupports various high-level programming languages like C, C++, and Fortran.\n\nUse Cases: General GPU-accelerated computing, scientific simulations, deep learning training & inference.\n\nTensorRT:\n\nDeveloper & Manufacturer: NVIDIA\nUnique Features:\n\nHigh-performance deep learning inference optimizer and runtime.\nReduces the model size for faster inferencing.\nProvides INT8 and FP16 optimizations for production deployments.\n\nUse Cases: Optimizing and deploying deep learning models for production environments, especially on NVIDIA GPUs.\n\nROCm (Radeon Open Compute):\n\nDeveloper & Manufacturer: AMD\nUnique Features:\n\nOpen-source platform for GPU-enabled HPC (High Performance Computing) computing.\nSupports a range of machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch.\n\nUse Cases: GPU-accelerated computing on AMD GPUs, scientific simulations, AI/ML training & inference.\n\nDirectML:\n\nDeveloper: Microsoft\nUnique Features:\n\nPart of the DirectX family, providing a low-level API for ML.\nHardware-accelerated and works with any DirectX 12-compatible GPU.\n\nUse Cases: GPU-accelerated ML inference in Windows applications.\n\n\nThese platforms are more akin to runtime environments than traditional “virtual machines.” Still, they are optimized for GPU operations, and they play a role similar to VMs by providing a bridge between high-level code and low-level hardware instructions.\nMain Benefits of GPU-optimized Platforms: 1. Performance: Accelerate computations that can be parallelized, dramatically reducing the time required for tasks like training deep learning models. 2. Efficiency: Better utilization of available GPU resources, ensuring that the hardware’s full capabilities are harnessed. 3. Portability: In some cases (like CUDA to some extent), the platform provides an abstraction over the hardware, allowing code to run on different GPU architectures (within limits and considering vendor lock-ins). 4. Integration with Popular Tools: Many of these platforms offer integrations with popular ML frameworks, making it easier to transition from research to production.\nHowever, it’s essential to understand that while these platforms provide the tools and runtime for GPU-optimized operations, they don’t function as “virtual machines” in the traditional sense of emulating a complete computing environment. They are closer to specialized compilers and runtime environments."

General Relativity extends these concepts to accelerating frames and introduces a revolutionary explanation for gravity as the curvature of spacetime caused by mass.\n\nPrimary Subdomains\n\nSpecial Relativity: Deals with inertial frames and high-speed phenomena.\n\nTime Dilation\nLength Contraction\nLorentz Transformation\nRelativistic Energy-Momentum\n\nGeneral Relativity: Focuses on gravity and accelerating (non-inertial) frames.\n\nGravitational Fields and Curved Spacetime\nBlack Holes\nCosmological Models\nGravitational Waves\n\nExperimental Tests of Relativity: Confirmations and challenges to relativistic predictions.\n\nGravitational Lensing\nTime Dilation in Particle Accelerators\nTests of the Equivalence Principle\n\n\n\n\nFields of Application\n\nAstrophysics: Understanding celestial bodies like black holes, neutron stars, and the large-scale structure of the universe.\nGlobal Positioning Systems (GPS): Accounting for relativistic effects to achieve precise location data.\nParticle Physics: Managing particles at high speeds in accelerators.\nCosmology: Explaining the Big Bang, cosmic inflation, and the fate of the universe.\nGravitational Wave Astronomy: Detecting and interpreting gravitational waves.\n\n\n\nAdditional Notes\n\nThe equations of relativity reduce to Newtonian equations at speeds much lower than the speed of light, demonstrating a natural continuity in physical laws.\nSpecial Relativity has implications for the unification of electromagnetism into a single theory, often termed as the “electroweak” interaction.\nGeneral Relativity, while incredibly successful at explaining large scale phenomena, is still incompatible with quantum mechanics. The reconciliation of these two theories is an open problem in theoretical physics, often referred to as the quest for a Theory of Everything (ToE).\n\nBy categorizing articles under this section, readers can gain an in-depth understanding of one of the most groundbreaking and far-reaching theories in physics."

It is named after Simon Donaldson, a British mathematician who made significant contributions to the field in the 1980s.\nThe central problem in Donaldson theory is to understand the topology of four-dimensional manifolds using differential geometry and algebraic topology. Specifically, the theory focuses on the study of vector bundles and connections on these manifolds, and how they can be used to classify different types of four-dimensional manifolds.\nOne of the key results in Donaldson theory is Donaldson’s theorem, which states that the intersection form of a smooth, closed, simply-connected four-dimensional manifold can be recovered from its Seiberg-Witten invariants. The Seiberg-Witten invariants are a set of numbers that can be associated with a four-dimensional manifold and its spin-c structure. They were introduced by Edward Witten and Nathan Seiberg in the mid-1990s and have proven to be a powerful tool in the study of four-dimensional manifolds.\nDonaldson theory has applications in a variety of fields, including physics, where it has been used to study the topology of spacetime in string theory and other areas of theoretical physics. It has also had significant impact in pure mathematics, inspiring further research in the fields of algebraic geometry, topology, and differential geometry."

People thought this was sweeping problems under the rug, but it also may have been a way of selecting good theories (renormalizable theories).\nFor example, theere’s nothing in the symmetries of quantum electrodynamics which rules out putting a term in the field equations (or Lagrangian), which could make the magnetic moment of the electron anything you want. This would make the mass of the electron -1, which means the theory is not renormalizable, and thus shows invalid.\nLate 1960s and early 70s, the standard model came to fruition - this was the renaissance of Quantum Field theory.

PROJECT WHITE HOT INTELLIGENCE ESTIMATE (PRELIMINARY)\nLANDING ZONE NO, 1 Socorro, New Mexico–the unidentified lenticular-shaped Aerodyne which has been designated ULAT-1, has been evaluated as a non air breathing aircraft of unknown origin. Totally lacking conventional wing, fuselage, nacelle, control, and fuel systems strongly indicates it is not Russian.\nConsultation with Paperclip specialists concur. Aerodynamic features exhibited in ULAT-1 represents a very high degree of engineering and sophistication not seen in this country.\nDimensional homogeneity study cannot explain how this craft sustains load and lift factors necessary for flight.\nThe power plant does not even remotely resemble any conventional type now in use. Lacking any discernible intake or exhaust features, it is the opinion of AMC and ONR that this craft was designed to operate outside of the earth’s atmosphere.\nThe unconventional conclusions reached by members of this fact finding mission remain tentative at this time. Some members have expressed the view that ULAT-1 may be the product of an advanced culture from another planet that is much older than ours and has utilized their science and intellect for interplanetary space travel. It is not precisely known if the occupants purposely had the objective of exploration and of curiosity or with the intent of surveying for other reasons. So far, no hostile action or intent has been observed since they made their presence known.\nGiven the fact that our atomic bomb tests, atmospheric exploration with rockets, and XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXed in New Mexico, could have precipitated the events that led to the incident and subsequent actions taken by the military.\nOperating under the assumption that the fallen object was a long-range Russian reconnaissance platform collecting aerial photographic intelligence data military intelligence personnel were a instructed to secure the craft, debris and any occupants as rapidly as possible.\nConcerns over possible exposure to civilian of unknown biological and chemical agents dictated the quarantine measures taken.\nRadiation hazards were assumed and protective measures were taken as well.\nIn the interest or National Security priorities it was necessary to detain civilian witnesses for interrogation to satisfy intelligence requirements and quash rumors that could alert potential espionage agents known to be in the vicinity.\nSeveral bodies were discovered.\nBecause on-site medical personnel were unsure of the physiological make up of the occupants, special preparations and preservation methods were employed. Autopsy information obtained so far suggests that the occupants mimic the features associated with Orientals.\nOutwardly, they appear human-like with but one exception, autopsy notes mention a rarely observed XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXs present which supports the premise that these beings originate from another planet.\nPART TWO TECHNICAL EVALUATION (PRELIMINARY) ULAT-1\nUpon close examination of the exterior surfaces of the craft’s fuselage, metallurgists found the the skin to be of a ferrous metal white in color. The metal exhibits all the characteristics of high grade steel. It was determined that the steel was cold-formed and heat created.\n\nTensile strength was estimated in excess of 50,000 pounds per square inch. Shear tests give the metal a durability rating above 175,000 pounds per square inch, making this fuselage extremely strong and heat resistant.\nStatic and pressure flow simulations were impressive. The low profile ration of 6-1 gives the aerodyne a great advantage in overcoming the restrictions of the boundary layer effect in high performance operations.\nSpan flanges are constructed in unusual kinematic design which is believed to allow strain relief at supersonic speeds. There were no visible signs of plate-stiffeners, there were no fasteners, weld, rivets, or fittings, holding the fuselage together.\nLack of wings, flaps, stabilizers, and surface central features, suggests that the craft is a lifting body.\nThere are no air intakes for exhaust.\nThere are no cables\nThere are no identifiable electronics (wiring, ignition, lights, instrument, compartment, engine, motors, vacuum tubes, solenoids, generators, heaters, etc.)\nThe power-plant, (severely damaged) XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXx neutronic engine. XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXx detected heavy water and deuterium (light hydrogen) elements appeared to be the primary ignitor. A series of coils and heavy magnets connected to the neutronic engine via an oddly arranged group of electrodes (actually not yet identified) appears to be the active force. One small motor was examined. It is encased in a pure aluminium capsule directly underneath the main compartment. There is a small exhaust aperture attached that was what can only be described as an helicoid mechanism XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX. The auxiliary motor may be articulated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNavigation and engine controls may be activated by tactile manipulation. Viewing may have been achieved by form of television imagery. Symbolic notation appears to be the form of flight and control indicators. Flat panels of unknown metal has been suggested as a device associated with the operation of the aerodyne was discovered and analyzed. It’s mode of operation and purpose is unknown.\nThe absence of provisions, berthing compartments and storage areas, suggest the notion that this craft may be a short range reconnaissance platform. The only recognizable features XXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\nMode of operation of operation is believed to be instrumentation and suggests that the aerodyne from reconstruction from available wreckage XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX biosensory and optical stimuli for these reasons:\n\nabsence of indicator signals Absence of any circular dials Absence of linear dials or moving pointers Absence of counters Absence of scopes No mechanical signal indicators 12. There were identifiable control types found among the assortment of artefacts that would indicate the operation of the propulsion unit was manually activated – no knobs, push buttons, toggle switches, levers, balls, handwheels, hand-cranks, or foot pedals were observed in the interior space of the flight cabin.\n\nThe apparent lack of additional clothing and equipment reinforces the belief that the occupants were engaged in a purely exploratory flight.\nIt is not presently known if electromagnetic radiation effects from the power plant had contributed to pilot error or death before impact. If inadequate shielding was the primary cause of pilot error XXXXXXXXXXXXXXs detected.\nIt is believed by some of the crash inspection personnel that sudden decompression and change in atmospheric pressure may have contributed to pilot error. Clothing removed from occupants do not resemble any pressure suit currently being tested by the Army or the Navy for high altitude experiments. Since temperature and humidity factors for the occupants is unknown, it is impossible to determine if decompression and temperature changed affected circulatory and dexterity functions. Although it is believed the occupants may have been overcome by some yet undiscovered pollutant or noxious fumes originating inside the craft.\nRotation or rapid oscillation could have been a contributing factor in pilot error. It is not known if organic effects played a part either since medical data is non-existent in which to make any judgment as to exact cause of death or machine failure.\nThe most probable cause of the crash is believed to be excessive acceleration combined with steep descent. The seating arrangement was transversely designed about the vertical axis of the occupants in a positive direction of flight. The panels removed from the craft resemble the ones taken from the occupants, suggesting a symbionic relationship between operator and the function of the aerodyne’s operation. A very tentative working theory was expressed by the scientific members of the inspection team that pilot-aerodyne interaction may occur via electronic-nonword symbols perceived through the tactile manipulation of the fingers feeding impulses to the brain and visa versa. All of which may suggest a non-inert quality or the materials existent as being a product or artificial intelligence.\nThe following elements were analyzed and found to exist in the small neutronic power plant that was found inside ULAT-l:\n\n\nUF6 in metallic form;\nhydrogen-fluoride gas;\nwater and uranium tetra fluoride;\npowdered magnesium and potassium chlorate,\nmetal similar to lead with a chocolate brown color;\nU-235 in metallic form;\nplastic-like material similar to NE 102,\nBeryllium,\nPure aluminium;\nThorium isotope material;\nPlutonium powder.\n\n\nScientists from Los Alamos and Sandia Base were alarmed that the power plant could possibly function as a bomb if the elements described above were processed in similar fashion as was done for the lens and shot-gun detonators. This originally was the first conclusion. After further evaluation, it was determined that since no recognizable firing circuits were identified, the threat or detonation did not exist.\nThe only evidence or circuitry found on the motor was thin plastic-like sheets fashioned like platters embossed on the exterior of the spherically-shaped casing coated by a thin film or pure silver. Under high power magnification it was observed a series of fine grid-like lines intersecting groups of dots arranged in circular patterns.\n\nPART III SCIENTIFIC PROBABILITIES\n\nBased on all available evidence collected from recovered exhibits currently under study by AHC, AFSWP, NEPA, AEC, ONA, NACA, JBDB, RAND, USAAF SAG. and MIT, are deemed extraterrestrial in nature. This conclusion was reached as a result of comparisons of artifacts XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX discovery in 1941. The technology is outside the scope of US science, even that of German rocket and aircraft development.\nInterplanetary space travel is possible provided adequate funding, necessary resources are made available, and national interest is piqued.\nOur solar system is not unique. Chances are favorable for intelligent life on other planets notwithstanding similar development not unlike our own.\nBeing that our culture is relatively young (in relation to the cosmic scale), it is possible that other cultures may have developed faster, or are much older and have avoided the pitfalls common in our historical and scientific development.\nHuman origins may not be constrained to one planet. Our genus may be found among solar systems similar to our own.\nThe laws of physics and genetics may have a genesis in a higher, structured order than once previously thought.\n\nPART IV POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS\nGiven the existing political climate in the US and the unstable conditions in Europe, it is the considered opinion of the members, that if the Administration went public with the information as found in this report now, the results would be damaging, even fatal to the world Political structure as it now exists. The following considerations were reviewed and debated, which led the mission to the following opinions:\n\nPublic trust of the political institutions may be eroded and possibly be held in disrepute.\nA complete revisioning make take place as institutions of higher learning thus calling into question the certainty of scientific knowledge.\nThe ability of the Armed Forces to secure National Security would be put in jeopardy and possibly lead to undue public fear and disorder.\nHistory and religion in the political context would probably suffer the most damage causing unprecedented upheaval in social and psychological well-being.\nPolitical repercussions may occur in our diplomatic efforts of containing the Communist threat to our democratic interests.\nIf such an announcement were made by the current Administration, it could be perceived by opposing party as a trick, laying open to accusations of unethetical (sic) posturing and manipulation of the public’s mind.\n\nPART V NATIONAL SECURITY STRUCTURE\nWith the passage of the National Security Act of 1947 XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXas presented an unprecedented situation regarding maintaining secrecy related to the information contained in this report.\nIn the early months of 1942, up until the present, intrusions of unidentified aircraft have occasionally been documented, but there has been no serious investigations by the intelligence arm of the Government. Even the recovery case of 1941 did not create a unified intelligence effort to exploit possible technological gains with the exception of the Manhattan Project. We now have an opportunity to extend our technology beyond the threshold that we have achieved, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX. Aside from technological gains, we face an even greater challenge, that of learning the intent of such a presence. There are questions that remain unanswered, such as: What forces face us? What kind of defense do we have? Where do they come from and what kind of weapons do they possess? Where can we stage our forces in advance, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX How wide a front? How many craft can we expect? And XXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\nThe members of the mission are prepared to submit a separate report on just this problem alone. And it would take a dozen volumes to explain how these problems should be met.\nOur only point, however, is that a combined intelligence and research operation would be a vast, intricate, covertly planned marshaling of resources, human and material, to solve a specific, clearly defined problem.\nWe have to find effective methods of persuasion with other government agencies without creating a sense of impending doom. The first task is to carefully appraise the problem. The second is to evaluate the known resources and probable strategy of the visitors. The third is to inventory our own ways and means, ascertain how much resources we can bring to bear, and how fast. The third is to devise our strategic plan. And last is to work out with infinite pains the tactical details and the myriad secondary problems of funding and security.\nIt is the unanimous opinion of the members that Operation MAJESTIC TWELVE be a fully funded ant operational TOP SECRET Research and Development intelligence gathering agency. It is also recommended that a panel of experts be appointed to chair and oversee the functions and operations of said agency. It’s members should have appropriate security clearances and full cooperation XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXX the National Security Council, the Pentagon, XXXXXXXht, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX Joint Intelligence Committee, Joint Intelligence Objectives Agency, Central Intelligence Agency, Atomic Energy Commission, Joint Research and Development Board, Army Security Agency, and the National Advisory Board on Aeronautics.\nXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXgy are highlighted:\n\nPropeller driven bomber aircraft and jet engines, armed with conventional and atomic bombs.\nJet fighter aircraft, including some of super­sonic speed, armed with rockets and guns.\nPropeller-driven aircraft, valued for their endurance. .\nGuided anti-aircraft missiles, and radar-guided anti-aircraft guns.\nShort and medium-range guided missiles. Drone aircraft.\nAtomic charges, in bombs, missiles and torpedoes.\n\nIn the arena of nuclear weapons we feel there is a certain advantage to be gained XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX. It is speculated by some that if reduced size and miniature circuitry were introduced into the proposed hydrogen bomb program, it would give US Strategic Air Forces a great deterrence capability over the Russians. Current studies at MIT of micro-electronics taken from ULAT-1 may give us the strategic advantage so desired. It is strongly recommended that funding be allocated in this area.\nThere is a good chance that the Russians may try to make use of the flying saucer scare by public news media and diplomatic means of a technological breakthrough in aircraft and missile development. We feel that such a disclosure would certainly cause great embarrassment to our elected officials and to the military, not to mention the panic felt by the citizenry. To counter such a threat, it is recommended that a counterintelligence program be drawn up and held in abeyance if at such time the situation should present itself. It might be suggested that we should make a preempted use of these objects for the purpose of psychological warfare once the true nature of these objects are known and understood.\nTo further assist and aid all MAJCOM in the US and overseas, it is recommended that a standard intelligence reporting system be implemented through standard reporting channels with technical data forwarding instructions. At present, there are no specific intelligence guidelines available to military commanders in dealing with sightings and material evidence collection. It would be advisable for the respective Secretaries of the Armed Forces to devise a security policy of plausible denial, if and when the public becomes aware of the reality of these objects and the interest of the military of such incidents.\nIn conclusion, for reasons of national security and the public well being, the US must be perceived as being the top of the heap and every effort must be made to insure that there is, and never has been, a threat to the country."

In every reference frame the light speed is the same, so “in the reference frame of light” makes no sense because there time is stopped. The EH can’t be seen on oo because for an observer between PS and EH there are a finite number of oscillations of his time reference from PS to EH The assumption that the universe could rotate leads to a complication of all physical laws. We would get that there then has to be a rotation axis of the universe and that all rules are different with relation to that axis so that speed along the rotation direction can exceed c with any multiple without problems of inertia. This is similar to the Hubble expansion with the difference of an absolute rotation axis. That is why I reject both assumptions. It makes no sense to assume that space rotates. We rotate inside space. It also makes no sense to assume that space expands. We shrink inside space. The big one, space, is invariant, flat, not rotating, not translating, not curving. The small, what is inside space, rotates, translates, changes size. The only property of space that has a variation is that the propagation speed of light depends on the mass/energy density distribution in space.\n\n\nIsn’t it easier for Hawking radiation to escape if black holes have hair? So it’s not perfectly curved there. How does this equation differ from the superfluid quantum gravity spinning vortice(s) model of black holes?\n\n\n@bgreene marveled about the beauty of the equation. He didn’t gave a judgement about its validity. I gave an explanation on what assumptions are needed to allow this metric equation to be applicable. You come with the concept of a radiating BH. That only asks wether a particle pair of matter and antimatter could split such that one falks into, and one escapes the BH. But since the propagation speed of light at the EH is equal to the EH nothing moves there. So a hairy EH would assume that this propagation speed distribution is not smooth. This then should lead to particle wave functions to start from “stand still” and move outward. Such phenomen would need a different metric equation, but would not alter the beauty of the equation that @bgreene mentioned."

Solid solution series occur when two or more different elements can substitute for each other in a mineral’s structure to a significant degree. Here, the variable x represents a range of compositions that can exist within this series.\nThe formula indicates that for every 6 units of phosphate (PO4) and one oxygen (O), there are 10-x lead (Pb) atoms and x copper (Cu) atoms. The “x” in the formula implies that the copper content can vary, essentially representing a range of similar minerals with varying amounts of copper and lead. As the copper content increases (x increases), the lead content decreases correspondingly.\nPlease note that this is a general explanation and the specifics of the mineral can vary greatly depending on its formation conditions and geological setting.\nIf you want to understand this equation thoroughly, you would need to delve into crystal chemistry and solid state physics.\nCrystal Chemistry: The substitution of Pb by Cu is possible due to similarities in their ionic radii and charge. Minerals form in specific crystalline structures and the substitution of one atom for another depends on these factors.\nSolid State Physics: The physical properties of this mineral series, such as its electrical conductivity or magnetic properties, would vary based on the exact ratio of Pb to Cu.

It’s not that the steel produced before these explosions is stronger or of better quality, but it’s that the steel manufactured after the start of the atomic age is slightly radioactive.\nIn 1945, when the first atomic bombs were detonated during World War II, they released various radionuclides, including Carbon-14 and other radioactive isotopes, into the atmosphere. These isotopes circled the globe and were incorporated into many things, including the iron ore used to produce steel. As a result, steel produced after 1945 can exhibit slight radioactivity.\nThis can be an issue in certain sensitive applications where even the tiniest amount of background radiation can interfere with equipment operation or measurements, like Geiger counters, certain medical equipment, and scientific devices used in physics and geology. For these uses, pre-war or low-background steel, typically salvaged from pre-1945 ships and buildings, is often sought.\n\n\nResearch\n\nLow-Background Steel Wiki\nReadiation Damage Wiki\nRadiation Effects in Steel\nInvestigation of Natural Radioactivity and Dose Assessment over Steel Making Region\nEffects of Irradiation on Mechanical Properties\nIs neutron radiation exposure always detrimental to metals (steels)?\nEffects of Radiation Damage"

    "text": "Animals\n\nBarbery Lions\n\nDiscovery Article: Barbary Lion Facts\n\nThe Barbary lion is one of the most spectacular beasts ever to have walked the face of the Earth. Known as the Berber lion, the North African lion, the Egyptian lion and the Atlas lion, this is one of history’s most famous animals.\nIn the vast deserts and mountains of the Barbary coast in North Africa, the Barbary lions once roamed freely. With their distinctly dark manes, they were thought to have been one of the largest lion species to have ever existed. These majestic creatures captured the imagination of many, and their historical significance reaches far back into antiquity.\nBarbary lions were not only remarkable for their appearance but also for their role in history. These same lions were regularly captured by hunters for the brutal games held in the Roman colosseum. Known as “Damnatio ad bestias” in Latin, this practice was a form of capital punishment where condemned prisoners were executed by Barbary lions and other large cats. The lions’ presence in such events added to their mythos and perpetuated their fame.\nThe decline of the Barbary lion population began with the expansion of the Arab empire from 632 to 1258, leading to the end of the Islamic Golden Age after the Siege of Baghdad by the Mongols. Survivors of that turbulent period claimed that “the waters of the Tigris ran black with ink from the enormous quantities of books flung into the river and red from the blood of the scientists and philosophers killed.” Amidst the turmoil in the region and as empires crumbled and fell, the Barbary lions managed to persist until the arrival of European colonists in the 19th century.\nDuring this time, big-game hunting gained popularity, and it proved to be devastating for the already dwindling lion population. As a result, sightings of Barbary lions became scarce, and not a single one was reported from 1901 to 1910. By the 1920s, most scientists believed that they had become extinct in the wild.\nThere were a few reported sightings in subsequent decades, offering glimmers of hope that some may have survived. In 1948, there was a reported sighting in Morocco, and in 1958, another sighting was claimed in a heavily forested area near the city of Sétif in Algeria. However, the forest was destroyed during the Algerian War in the same year, further exacerbating the challenges faced by these noble creatures.\nToday, approximately 100 captive lions possess the genes of the Barbary lions, but none of them are pure descendants. While these lions carry a part of their ancestral legacy, the extinction of the Barbary lions in the wild serves as a stark reminder of the consequences of human actions on the delicate balance of nature. The story of the Barbary lion stands as a poignant testament to the importance of conservation efforts to protect and preserve the incredible diversity of life on our planet."

    "text": "The Effect of Mandatory Masks on Autism in Children\n\nBut hopefully, this [mask mandate in schools] will be a temporary thing, temporary enough that it [masks] doesn’t have any lasting negative impact on them [children]. - Anthony Fauci, August 9 2021\n\n\nRecognition of Faces: An Approach to the Study of Autism\n\nTwo age groups of normal, autistic and subnormal children were tested for their ability to recognize the faces of peers from isolated facial features and inverted photographs. The normal and subnormal subjects found the upper regions of the face most helpful for identification, whereas the younger autistic children found the lower features more helpful. The older autistic children showed no specific reliance on any one area, but were found to have error scores as low as those of the younger autistic children on the recognition of lower parts and error scores as low as the; controls on recognizing upper portions. The results are discussed and are found to favour a hypothesis in which the autistic child’s familiarity with the mouth and/or eye areas is related to a cognitive deficit which affects the processing of both verbal and non-verbal interpersonal communication.\n\nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics Poster, Highlighting the Importance of Facial Expressions for Children\n\nThey later were swallowed by the narrative, and made a public statement that in-school masks does not affect children (hypocritical)\n\nVisual Impairment: Its Effect on Cognitive Development and Behavior\nInfants Deploy Selective Attention to the Mouth of a Talking Face when Learning Speech\n\nThe mechanisms underlying the acquisition of speech-production ability in human infancy are not well understood. We tracked 4–12-mo-old English-learning infants’ and adults’ eye gaze while they watched and listened to a female reciting a monologue either in their native (English) or nonnative (Spanish) language. We found that infants shifted their attention from the eyes to the mouth between 4 and 8 mo of age regardless of language and then began a shift back to the eyes at 12 mo in response to native but not nonnative speech. We posit that the first shift enables infants to gain access to redundant audiovisual speech cues that enable them to learn their native speech forms and that the second shift reflects growing native-language expertise that frees them to shift attention to the eyes to gain access to social cues. On this account, 12-mo-old infants do not shift attention to the eyes when exposed to nonnative speech because increasing native-language expertise and perceptual narrowing make it more difficult to process nonnative speech and require them to continue to access redundant audiovisual cues. Overall, the current findings demonstrate that the development of speech production capacity relies on changes in selective audiovisual attention and that this depends critically on early experience.\n\nUnderstanding the Impact of Face Masks on the Processing of Facial Identity, Emotion, Age, and Gender\n\nThis is not even about children in particular, but illustrates how it may be detremential to young people in a learning phase\nAbstract Result: The results revealed that masks hindered the perception of virtually all tested facial dimensions (i.e., emotion, gender, age, and identity), interfering with normal speed and accuracy of categorization. We also found that the unwarranted effects of masks were not due to holistic processes, because the Face Inversion Effect (FIE) was generally not larger with unmasked compared with masked faces. Moreover, we found that the impact of masks is not automatic and that under some contexts observers can control at least part of their detrimental effects.\n\nFace masks reduce emotion-recognition accuracy and perceived closeness\n\nAgain, this was on adults, because you wouldn’t be able to publish your findings in 2021 if you exposed what it does to children\n\n\nIMPORTANT\n\nEmotion comprehension between 3 and 11 years: Developmental periods and hierarchical organization\nDarwin’s Contributions of our Understanding of Emotional Expressions\nInfants deploy selective attention to the mouth of a talking face when learning speech\nPotential Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Communication and Language Skills in Children\nEffect of face mask and noise on word recognition by children and adults\n\nThis PDF was taken off the web! I am linking it through Wayback machine\n\nThe puzzle of Autism in the time of COVID-19 pandemic: “Light it up Blue”\n\n“… Barriers to essential services such as speech and occupational therapies, combined with loss of routine and predictability has widened the gap between needs and provided care. Parents, teachers and health care should aim to work collectively for a broadened approach that is child/parent centered to compensate for most of disrupted vital support and services”"

But it has a giant gaping flaw in it, which is; Any cell of yours that produces a foreign protein, will be targetted by your immune system and destroyed. You will create an autoimmune disorder. When it works. How do you keep it out of your heart. Not by coding it in a lipid nanoparticle. So, they had no way to deliver it safely to market. So then they had a pandemic, the emergency allowed them to do it. This technology, in my opinion, was at least 3 decades out from being usefully and safely deployed at all, if at all. They did not want to wait, this crisis gave them the opportunity not to wait. And now, they will blame the spike protein, we picked the wrong protein. When in actual fact there are 2 problems, the spike protein and the platform itself. - Brett Weinstein\n\n\nMyocarditis/Pericarditis\n\nDifferent virus vs vax myocarditis mechanisms isn’t just theory. Here’s why you’re correct in real life.\n\n\nTIMING\n\nVirus myocarditis As Offit said, SARS2 viral myocarditis most often manifests as post-viral myocarditis due to molecular mimicry.\n\nThis means a few to several weeks after covid infection (ie symptoms/viral load were already gone weeks or 1-2 months ago), there is Ab/T crossreactivity (mimicry) to self-antigens in heart cells.\nThis mechanism is most often mild, good prognosis.\nTo clarify, SARS2 viral fulminant myocarditis, which can occur in days to a week after covid infection, is very rare. Initial covid presentation with fulminant myocarditis is so rare and unusual, it’s a case report. Almost all SARS2 viral myocarditis is post-viral and mild.\n\nVax myocarditis Most often occurs days to 1 week after 2nd vax dose. Also occurs after 1st vax dose or booster.\n\nThis timing is atypical of mimicry. Rather, this timing is textbook for a primary or secondary direct immune cell attack on mRNA-transfected heart cells.\nOffit knows all this. He’s obviously pulling a “limited hangout”. Pfizer will copy what Offit says.\nIf politicians were honest, they’d ask if mechanisms are the same (mimicry) for both virus and vax myo, then why are the timing and severity distinctly different for virus vs vax myo?\n\n\nSerum Vax Spike\n\nCirculating Spike Protein Detected in Post–COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine Myocarditis\n\nThere’s a high correlation of vax spike found in serum (blood) of vax myocarditis. Vax controls showed no serum vax spike.\nImportantly, Ab/T immunoprofiling of vax myocarditis patients were indistinguishable from vax controls (ie no unusual autoantibodies or autoreactive T cells (no mimicry signs)).\nThis is more evidence that in vax myo, your immune cells are killing your own heart cells that look virus-infected.\nThere’s more vax myo mechanisms like inflammasome or apoptosis. But you said the main vax myo mechanism perfectly.”"

    "text": "Cold as a Therapeutic Agent\nCold for Centuries\nHuman physiological responses to immersion into water of different temperatures\nAltered brown fat thermoregulation and enhanced cold-induced thermogenesis in young, healthy, winter-swimming men\nImpact of Cold-Water Immersion Compared with Passive Recovery Following a Single Bout of Strenuous Exercise on Athletic Performance in Physically Active Participants\nNovel Application of Chemical Cold Packs for Treatment of Exercise-Induced Hyperthermia\nShort-term cold exposure supports human Treg induction in vivo\nDifferences between men and women\n\n\n\nThe use of cold-water immersion has a long and rich history. The beneficial effects on human physiology have been recorded as far back as 3500BC @Wang Et Al., with the Edwin Smith Papyrus (the most ancient medical text known to date) making references to cold being used for therapeutic purposes. The Ancient Greeks utilized cold-water therapies, as recorded by Hippocrates in the fourth century BC. And even the Golden Age of Rome featured cold-water immersion as treatment for fever, advocated for by Roman Physician Claudius Galen in the second century AD @Allan Et Al.. It was only until recently, however, that modern science began to explore the underlying physiological processes behind the power of the cold.\n\n\n\nDeliberate cold exposure triggers a release of epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine (noradrenaline) into the bloodstream. These hormones are responsible for the fight-or-flight response, and can make us feel alert and/or agitated @Huberman. This is why many people feel more energized after a cold shower or a cold swim.\n\n\n\nCold exposure has been shown to increase energy expenditure, which can lead to weight loss and improved body composition. It has been recommended as a healthy and sustainable alternative strategy for increasing energy expenditure @van Marken Lichtenbelt Et Al..\nA core aspect of cold exposure is the activation of brown adipose tissue (BAT). BAT is a type of fat tissue that is responsible for thermogenesis, or the production of heat. It is found in small amounts in adults, but is more abundant in children. It is also found in higher concentrations in people who are leaner. The activation of BAT is thought to be responsible for the increased energy expenditure that is observed after cold exposure @Huberman.\n\n\n\nA study published in the Journal of Applied Physiology found that cold exposure “induced a leukocytosis and granulocytosis, an increase in natural killer cell count and activity, and a rise in circulating levels of interleukin-6.” @Brenner Et Al.. In other words, this means that cold exposure increases the number of white blood cells, which are responsible for fighting infection, and increases the activity of natural killer cells, which are responsible for destroying cancer cells. It also increases the production of interleukin-6, which is a cytokine that plays a role in the immune response.\nA fundamental aspect of cold exposure therapy is the subconcious respiratory response by the sympathetic nervous system. Upon cold immersion, you may find your breathing rate to increase, and your breaths to deepen. It was traditionally believed that the sympathetic nervous system and immune system could not be voluntarily influenced.\nIn 2011, however, the “Ice Man” Wim Hof participated in a study wherein he was injected with endotoxin, a treated form of E coli bacteria which triggers the same immune response. The study produced groundbreaking results, claiming that through the use of Hof’s breathing technique, he voluntarily and significantly increased his immune system response to the bacteria and completely avoided the flu-like symptoms displayed by healthy participants within the control group. In an attempt to discover if this result was reproducable or an anomoly of Wim Hof himself, a study published in the National Library of Medicine in 2014 replicated the methods with individuals who were trained on the breathing technique prior to the injection. It was again found that the breathing technique resulted in an immediate and profound decrease of pCO2 and bicarbonate, and an increase in pH, indicating acute respiratory alkalosis, which normalized quickly after cessation of the breathing techniques. In laymans terms, this means that humans could, through the use of breathing techniques, voluntarily increase immune system activity.\n\n\n\nCold exposure has been shown to increase the production of endorphins, such as dopmain, which are responsible for the “runner’s high” and other feelings of euphoria. It has also been shown to increase the production of serotonin, which is responsible for feelings of happiness and well-being. Increased dopamin release can last for as long as 6 hours after cold exposure, and increased serotonin release can last for as long as 24 hours after cold exposure @Ootsuka.\n\n\n\nCold water immersion has been reported to increase the level of T-cells (specifically, peripheral T lymphocytes). This has been observed both (1) in the short term after a single treatment/swim, as well as (2) in a longer, sustained manner after a period of multiple treatments per week.\nT-cells, also known as T lymphocytes, are a type of white blood cell that are derived from bone marrow stem cells and mature in the thymus gland. They play an essential role in fighting off infection. With an ability to “recognize” and “remember” germs that they have seen before, they can quickly respond if they see that germ again.\nIn other studies, similar increases have been observed for NK (Natural killer) cells. NK cell activity has been observed to increase both briefly after a treatment and in a sustained manner following consistent and repeated immersions.\nNatural killer (NK) cells are a type of white blood cell that can quickly recognize and destroy infected or cancerous cells without prior exposure or activation. NK cells do not require prior exposure to antigens, which are proteins or other molecules that can trigger an immune response. Instead, they use a variety of receptors to detect abnormal cells and then release toxic substances to kill them.\n\n\n\nAlthough the science is still developing, there is reason to believe cold water immersion may help prevent the risk of tumors and cancers.\nIn a study done on lab mice, a “somewhat reduced spontaneous incidence of tumors, especially sarcomas” was observed among the group of mice that endured repeated cold stress (cold swims). It has also been reported that Cold-inducible RNA binding protein (CIRP) may function as a tumor suppressor via suppressing proliferation. Finally, there’s been a clinical review performed by the National Institute of Health (NIH) exploring the cold’s ability to stimulate “anti-tumor immunity”, which concluded this area deserves “more research as a major target for cancer therapies.”\nWe look forward to the progression of this research.\n\n\n\nWestern biomedical research is gradually discovering the significance of the way in which we breathe, in relation to the body and its many physiological processes. Among these discoveries are how deliberate breathing techniques can 1. increase our tolerance to extremely cold environments and 2. alter immune function in real time.\nLet me highlight the significance of these discoveries: For centuries, modern (Western) medicine considered these processes (circulatory system, immune system, sympathetic nervous system) autonomic or involuntary, meaning they are unable to be controlled consciously. Recent research has slipped this understanding upside down - essentially, deliberate breathing practice is a superpower.\nThere is incredible research on breathing methods/techniques beyond the scope of this article, spanning brain function, enlightened & hallucinogenic states, mood/emotion control, and more. We encourage you to explore it if you’re interested, and we hope to come back to the topic in a future article/series.\nThe first groundbreaking study was done on Wim “The Ice Man” Hof, himself. In 2011, researchers at Radboud University injected Wim Hof with endotoxin, a treated form of bacteria that triggers a general immune response, as Wim practiced his breathing technique. The results were astounding:\n\n…levels of inflammatory mediators in Hof’s blood were much lower. On average, Hof’s immune response was decreased by 50 percent compared to other healthy volunteers. In addition, hardly any flu-like symptoms were observed.\n\nAt first, this study was a target of skepticism. With a sample size of 1, it was unclear whether the results were reproducible or simply Wim Hof producing an outlier result as an individual. However, it was enough to encourage further exploration.\nIn 2014, a study published in the National Library of Medicine sought out to reproduce the 2011 results in average “healthy participants”. The intervention group was trained for just 10 minutes in Hof’s breathing technique, and then both groups were administered with the endotoxin.\n\nIn the intervention group, practicing the learned techniques resulted in intermittent respiratory alkalosis and hypoxia resulting in profoundly increased plasma epinephrine levels. In the intervention group, plasma levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 increased more rapidly after endotoxin administration, correlated strongly with preceding epinephrine levels, and were higher. Levels of proinflammatory mediators TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-8 were lower in the intervention group and correlated negatively with IL-10 levels. Finally, flu-like symptoms were lower in the intervention group.\n\nIn summary, the results were successfully reproduced, and the researchers concluded that it is possible to voluntarily activate the sympathetic nervous system and affect immune response through deliberate breathing technique.\nHof’s breathing technique shook the biomedical science industry again in 2018, this time after he showed humans can consciously enhance their ability to survive in extremely cold conditions (beyond what was previously thought possible). The study concluded that deliberate breathing technique resulted in “increased sympathetic innervation and glucose consumption in intercostal muscle, generating heat that dissipates to lung tissue and warms circulating blood in the pulmonary capillaries.”\n\n\n\nThe optimal, and most studied, approach entails complete submersion in cold water from the neck down. To sit in water from the chest down, with arms outstretched, for instance, precludes full stimulation of the stress response mechanisms which yield many of the advantages discussed in the previous two sections of this series.\nLikewise, although cold showers have demonstrated efficacy, they have not been subjected to the same level of scrutiny as cold water immersion from the neck down. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that the most optimal results may be obtained through full immersion in cold water. In the event that access to a cold bath is unattainable, cold showers serve as a reasonable alternative.\n\n\n\nThe short answer to this question is: uncomfortable but safe. Discomfort means that the beneficial stress hormones discussed in part 1 are being released in your system, thus offering the corresponding benefits.\nIf you are getting started, you may find that water temperatures around 45 degrees Fahrenheit is enough to feel uncomfortable. Over time, you are likely to find your cold immersion routine becomes easier. If you want to progress, and continue to extract maximum benefit, you must be honest with yourself to recognize whether you are pushing yourself, and increase intensity (decrease temperature) as appropriate.\n\n\n\nA study done by Scandinavian scientist Dr. Susanna Søeberg suggests the magic number is at least 11 minutes per week, total. This is the threshold needed to increase brown fat thermogenesis and metabolism. This could be done in various ways, such as spreading it out throughout the week or doing it all in one day.\n\n\n\nScience suggests that whether cold exposure is done in the morning or at night does not affect the health benefits discussed previously. However, I personally recommend doing your cold exposure first thing in the morning.\nThe reason why relates to internal body temperature and circadian rhythm. Your body is warm when it is awake, and cold when it is asleep. In fact, studies have shown your body temperature must decrease by 1.5 degrees in order to fall asleep.\nExposure to cold temperatures can cause your body to heat up afterwards, making it more difficult to fall asleep if done late at night. On the other hand, if performed early in the morning, cold exposure may boost your energy levels and start your day off on the right foot.\n\n\n\nThe Søeberg Principle, developed by Dr. Susana Søeberg, posits the following:\nTo enhance the metabolic effects of cold, force your body to reheat on its own\n\nEnd With Cold\n\nAdditionally, the act of shivering during or after cold exposure can further activate brown fat thermogenesis and release heat from muscles, resulting in heightened metabolic increases.\nTo increase shivering and optimize the metabolic benefits of cold exposure, individuals are advised to avoid huddling and wrapping their arms around themselves while in the cold or after exiting it. Likewise, entering a sauna after cold exposure, although relaxing, will limit the metabolic benefits of the cold.\nIf you want to go further, it is recommended to refrain from towel drying and instead allowing the body to naturally reheat and dry off. Admittedly, this is difficult, especially when it’s cold outside."

Discomfort means that the beneficial stress hormones discussed in part 1 are being released in your system, thus offering the corresponding benefits.\nIf you are getting started, you may find that water temperatures around 45 degrees Fahrenheit is enough to feel uncomfortable.

    "section": "The Cold Hard Facts, Part 1",
    "text": "The Cold Hard Facts, Part 1\nThe use of cold-water immersion has a long and rich history. The beneficial effects on human physiology have been recorded as far back as 3500BC @Wang Et Al., with the Edwin Smith Papyrus (the most ancient medical text known to date) making references to cold being used for therapeutic purposes. The Ancient Greeks utilized cold-water therapies, as recorded by Hippocrates in the fourth century BC. And even the Golden Age of Rome featured cold-water immersion as treatment for fever, advocated for by Roman Physician Claudius Galen in the second century AD @Allan Et Al.. It was only until recently, however, that modern science began to explore the underlying physiological processes behind the power of the cold.\n\nEnergy and Focus\nDeliberate cold exposure triggers a release of epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine (noradrenaline) into the bloodstream. These hormones are responsible for the fight-or-flight response, and can make us feel alert and/or agitated @Huberman. This is why many people feel more energized after a cold shower or a cold swim.\n\n\nMetabolism\nCold exposure has been shown to increase energy expenditure, which can lead to weight loss and improved body composition. It has been recommended as a healthy and sustainable alternative strategy for increasing energy expenditure @van Marken Lichtenbelt Et Al..\nA core aspect of cold exposure is the activation of brown adipose tissue (BAT). BAT is a type of fat tissue that is responsible for thermogenesis, or the production of heat. It is found in small amounts in adults, but is more abundant in children. It is also found in higher concentrations in people who are leaner. The activation of BAT is thought to be responsible for the increased energy expenditure that is observed after cold exposure @Huberman.\n\n\nImmune Health\nA study published in the Journal of Applied Physiology found that cold exposure “induced a leukocytosis and granulocytosis, an increase in natural killer cell count and activity, and a rise in circulating levels of interleukin-6.” @Brenner Et Al.. In other words, this means that cold exposure increases the number of white blood cells, which are responsible for fighting infection, and increases the activity of natural killer cells, which are responsible for destroying cancer cells. It also increases the production of interleukin-6, which is a cytokine that plays a role in the immune response.\nA fundamental aspect of cold exposure therapy is the subconcious respiratory response by the sympathetic nervous system. Upon cold immersion, you may find your breathing rate to increase, and your breaths to deepen. It was traditionally believed that the sympathetic nervous system and immune system could not be voluntarily influenced.\nIn 2011, however, the “Ice Man” Wim Hof participated in a study wherein he was injected with endotoxin, a treated form of E coli bacteria which triggers the same immune response. The study produced groundbreaking results, claiming that through the use of Hof’s breathing technique, he voluntarily and significantly increased his immune system response to the bacteria and completely avoided the flu-like symptoms displayed by healthy participants within the control group. In an attempt to discover if this result was reproducable or an anomoly of Wim Hof himself, a study published in the National Library of Medicine in 2014 replicated the methods with individuals who were trained on the breathing technique prior to the injection. It was again found that the breathing technique resulted in an immediate and profound decrease of pCO2 and bicarbonate, and an increase in pH, indicating acute respiratory alkalosis, which normalized quickly after cessation of the breathing techniques. In laymans terms, this means that humans could, through the use of breathing techniques, voluntarily increase immune system activity.\n\n\nMood\nCold exposure has been shown to increase the production of endorphins, such as dopmain, which are responsible for the “runner’s high” and other feelings of euphoria. It has also been shown to increase the production of serotonin, which is responsible for feelings of happiness and well-being. Increased dopamin release can last for as long as 6 hours after cold exposure, and increased serotonin release can last for as long as 24 hours after cold exposure @Ootsuka.\n\n\nCold Immersion, T-Cells, and NK Cells\nCold water immersion has been reported to increase the level of T-cells (specifically, peripheral T lymphocytes). This has been observed both (1) in the short term after a single treatment/swim, as well as (2) in a longer, sustained manner after a period of multiple treatments per week.\nT-cells, also known as T lymphocytes, are a type of white blood cell that are derived from bone marrow stem cells and mature in the thymus gland. They play an essential role in fighting off infection. With an ability to “recognize” and “remember” germs that they have seen before, they can quickly respond if they see that germ again.\nIn other studies, similar increases have been observed for NK (Natural killer) cells. NK cell activity has been observed to increase both briefly after a treatment and in a sustained manner following consistent and repeated immersions.\nNatural killer (NK) cells are a type of white blood cell that can quickly recognize and destroy infected or cancerous cells without prior exposure or activation. NK cells do not require prior exposure to antigens, which are proteins or other molecules that can trigger an immune response. Instead, they use a variety of receptors to detect abnormal cells and then release toxic substances to kill them.\n\n\nCold Immersion & Cancer\nAlthough the science is still developing, there is reason to believe cold water immersion may help prevent the risk of tumors and cancers.\nIn a study done on lab mice, a “somewhat reduced spontaneous incidence of tumors, especially sarcomas” was observed among the group of mice that endured repeated cold stress (cold swims). It has also been reported that Cold-inducible RNA binding protein (CIRP) may function as a tumor suppressor via suppressing proliferation. Finally, there’s been a clinical review performed by the National Institute of Health (NIH) exploring the cold’s ability to stimulate “anti-tumor immunity”, which concluded this area deserves “more research as a major target for cancer therapies.”\nWe look forward to the progression of this research.\n\n\nThe Role of the Breath\nWestern biomedical research is gradually discovering the significance of the way in which we breathe, in relation to the body and its many physiological processes. Among these discoveries are how deliberate breathing techniques can 1. increase our tolerance to extremely cold environments and 2. alter immune function in real time.\nLet me highlight the significance of these discoveries: For centuries, modern (Western) medicine considered these processes (circulatory system, immune system, sympathetic nervous system) autonomic or involuntary, meaning they are unable to be controlled consciously. Recent research has slipped this understanding upside down - essentially, deliberate breathing practice is a superpower.\nThere is incredible research on breathing methods/techniques beyond the scope of this article, spanning brain function, enlightened & hallucinogenic states, mood/emotion control, and more. We encourage you to explore it if you’re interested, and we hope to come back to the topic in a future article/series.\nThe first groundbreaking study was done on Wim “The Ice Man” Hof, himself. In 2011, researchers at Radboud University injected Wim Hof with endotoxin, a treated form of bacteria that triggers a general immune response, as Wim practiced his breathing technique. The results were astounding:\n\n…levels of inflammatory mediators in Hof’s blood were much lower. On average, Hof’s immune response was decreased by 50 percent compared to other healthy volunteers. In addition, hardly any flu-like symptoms were observed.\n\nAt first, this study was a target of skepticism. With a sample size of 1, it was unclear whether the results were reproducible or simply Wim Hof producing an outlier result as an individual. However, it was enough to encourage further exploration.\nIn 2014, a study published in the National Library of Medicine sought out to reproduce the 2011 results in average “healthy participants”. The intervention group was trained for just 10 minutes in Hof’s breathing technique, and then both groups were administered with the endotoxin.\n\nIn the intervention group, practicing the learned techniques resulted in intermittent respiratory alkalosis and hypoxia resulting in profoundly increased plasma epinephrine levels. In the intervention group, plasma levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 increased more rapidly after endotoxin administration, correlated strongly with preceding epinephrine levels, and were higher. Levels of proinflammatory mediators TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-8 were lower in the intervention group and correlated negatively with IL-10 levels. Finally, flu-like symptoms were lower in the intervention group.\n\nIn summary, the results were successfully reproduced, and the researchers concluded that it is possible to voluntarily activate the sympathetic nervous system and affect immune response through deliberate breathing technique.\nHof’s breathing technique shook the biomedical science industry again in 2018, this time after he showed humans can consciously enhance their ability to survive in extremely cold conditions (beyond what was previously thought possible). The study concluded that deliberate breathing technique resulted in “increased sympathetic innervation and glucose consumption in intercostal muscle, generating heat that dissipates to lung tissue and warms circulating blood in the pulmonary capillaries.”\n\n\nMethod\nThe optimal, and most studied, approach entails complete submersion in cold water from the neck down. To sit in water from the chest down, with arms outstretched, for instance, precludes full stimulation of the stress response mechanisms which yield many of the advantages discussed in the previous two sections of this series.\nLikewise, although cold showers have demonstrated efficacy, they have not been subjected to the same level of scrutiny as cold water immersion from the neck down. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that the most optimal results may be obtained through full immersion in cold water. In the event that access to a cold bath is unattainable, cold showers serve as a reasonable alternative.\n\n\nHow Cold is “Cold”?\nThe short answer to this question is: uncomfortable but safe. Discomfort means that the beneficial stress hormones discussed in part 1 are being released in your system, thus offering the corresponding benefits.\nIf you are getting started, you may find that water temperatures around 45 degrees Fahrenheit is enough to feel uncomfortable. Over time, you are likely to find your cold immersion routine becomes easier. If you want to progress, and continue to extract maximum benefit, you must be honest with yourself to recognize whether you are pushing yourself, and increase intensity (decrease temperature) as appropriate.\n\n\nHow Often/Long Should I be Cold?\nA study done by Scandinavian scientist Dr. Susanna Søeberg suggests the magic number is at least 11 minutes per week, total. This is the threshold needed to increase brown fat thermogenesis and metabolism. This could be done in various ways, such as spreading it out throughout the week or doing it all in one day.\n\n\nWhen Should I Get Cold?\nScience suggests that whether cold exposure is done in the morning or at night does not affect the health benefits discussed previously.

    "text": "Portabello Mushrooms\nConsumption of the Agaricus species mushrooms has increased considerably in Japan as the Japanese have become accustomed to Western cooking. The Agaricus species mushroom contains hydrazine derivatives known as Agaritine.\n\nRisks\n\nFrom Paul Stamets\n\nPortabellos have a problem. All mushrooms should be cooked, and portabellos, in particular, should be cooked at high temperatures.\n\n\nThere is an unfortunate group of compounds called agaritines. Agaritines are hydrazines that are heat unstable, so the good news is, you should cook them, and if you cook them well, then those mushrooms are not a problem. If you don’t cook them well, then these hydrazines are potentially problematic.\n\n\nNow, nature’s a numbers game: so, there are beneficial compounds, that, in some balance, may outweigh the negative effects of the hydrazines, the agaratines in these mushrooms, but that jury is still out so to speak.\n\n\n\nAcademic Papers\nAgaritine from Agaricus blazei Murrill induces apoptosis in the leukemic cell line U937 - paper Summary - Agaritine, a compound found in the medicinal mushroom Agaricus blazei Murrill, induces apoptosis (programmed cell death) in the leukemic cell line U937. - Agaritine treatment caused a dose-dependent increase in apoptosis in U937 cells, as measured by the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria and the activation of caspases. - Agaritine also induced the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins, such as Bax and Fas, and inhibited the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins, such as Bcl-2. - These findings suggest that agaritine may have potential as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of leukemia.\n\nAgaritine treatment caused a significant increase in the number of apoptotic cells in U937 cultures, as measured by flow cytometry.\nAgaritine also induced the characteristic morphological changes of apoptosis, such as nuclear condensation and fragmentation.\nWestern blot analysis showed that agaritine treatment increased the expression of Bax and Fas, and decreased the expression of Bcl-2.\nThese findings suggest that agaritine may trigger apoptosis in U937 cells by activating caspases and upregulating pro-apoptotic proteins. The authors of the paper concluded that agaritine may have potential as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of leukemia. However, further studies are needed to confirm these findings and to determine the optimal dose and schedule of agaritine treatment.\n\nQuantities of agaritine in mushrooms (Agaricus bisporus) and the carcinogenicity of mushroom methanol extracts on the mouse bladder epithelium - paper Summary - Agaritine is a carcinogenic compound found in mushrooms, including Agaricus bisporus (white button mushrooms). - The authors of the paper measured the levels of agaritine in Agaricus bisporus mushrooms and found that the levels varied depending on the growing conditions. - The authors also found that methanol extracts of Agaricus bisporus mushrooms were carcinogenic to the mouse bladder epithelium. - These findings suggest that agaritine may be a risk factor for bladder cancer in humans.\n\nThe authors measured the levels of agaritine in Agaricus bisporus mushrooms grown in different conditions, including open fields, greenhouses, and dark rooms.\nThe levels of agaritine were highest in mushrooms grown in dark rooms, followed by mushrooms grown in greenhouses, and then mushrooms grown in open fields.\nThe authors also found that methanol extracts of Agaricus bisporus mushrooms were carcinogenic to the mouse bladder epithelium.\nThis was determined by the induction of tumors in the mouse bladder after treatment with the methanol extracts. The authors concluded that agaritine may be a risk factor for bladder cancer in humans.\n\nSynthetic and Naturally Occurring Hydrazines as Possible Cancer Causative Agents - paper Summary - Hydrazines are a class of compounds that have been shown to be carcinogenic in animals. - Several synthetic hydrazines have been shown to cause cancer in humans, including 1,2-diethylhydrazine, 1,2-dinitrohydrazine, and 1,2-dibromohydrazine. Hydrazines are also found naturally in some foods, including mushrooms, tobacco, and fish. - There is some evidence that naturally occurring hydrazines may also be carcinogenic, but more research is needed to confirm this. - The authors of the paper conclude that hydrazines are a potential risk factor for cancer, and that further research is needed to determine the extent of this risk.\n\nThe authors reviewed the literature on hydrazines and cancer, and identified 19 synthetic hydrazines that have been shown to be carcinogenic in animals.\nThe authors also identified several naturally occurring hydrazines that have been found in foods, including agaritine, gyromitrin, and BMAA.\nThe authors concluded that hydrazines are a potential risk factor for cancer, and that further research is needed to determine the extent of this risk. It is important to note that this paper was published in 1975, and there has been some research on hydrazines and cancer since then. However, the authors’ conclusions are still valid, and further research is still needed to determine the extent of the risk of cancer from hydrazines.\n\nGenotoxicity of agaritine in the lacI transgenic mouse mutation assay: evaluation of the health risk of mushroom consumption - paper - Google Bard would not summarize this paper as it did for every other one (???) - TAKE A DEEPER LOOK &gt; Using a previously derived quantitative correlation between mutagenicity in the lacI test and carcinogenic potency, the carcinogenicity of agaritine in mushrooms was estimated: the average Swiss mushroom consumption of 4 g/day would be expected to contribute a lifetime cumulative cancer risk of about two cases per 100,000 lives.\nAttempted tumor induction with agaritine in mice. - paper"

What’s the risk-adjusted rate at which you would park 8+ figures on Binance, or Deribit? This is a serious question that crypto firms (HFT shops, VC firms) decide internally…\nIn other words, if Binance were a public company, where would their credit default swaps trade?\nCounter to what @cryptohayes initially described in his early writings, Ethena must avoid custodying the assets at the exchanges. Instead, park the assets with a secure third party (Fireblocks, Ledger, Copper), form agreements with the exchanges to accept this (likely some form of ZK-Proof of stETH asset balance) as collateral, and simply settle funding payments on the derivatives intermittently.\nThis doesn’t exactly eliminate all counterparty risk (can expand on this in the future), but it ensures assets are safu. I’m not sure this is actually Ethena’s plan, but it appears to be the only sufficient solution (assuming CEXs agree to the setup).\n\nAddressing Basis Risk\n\nThe question/issue is what happens when (not if) the perp-spot spread flips, and the delta-neutral position begins to bleed (rather than accrue) funding payments.\nFounder @leptokurtic gives the TLDR mitigation/assumptions here\nhttps://twitter.com/leptokurtic_/status/1682781081068769280?s=20\n\nI will focus on one of Ethena’s core assumptions, specifically that the “natural funding rate” is positive. Imo, this is where an interesting discussion lies.\n\nTo be clear, this assumption is not baseless - it is both supported by historical ETH perp data, and is generally true across (almost) all derivative markets.\n\n\n\n\nHowever, I subscribe to two principles which may complicate this assumption.\n\nThe Observer Effect: The act of observing or measuring a system necessarily disturbs or changes the system.\nSoros’s Reflexivity of Markets: Market participants’ imperfect understanding of the world influences their actions, and those actions, in turn, influence the world in ways that can confirm or contradict their initial beliefs.\n\n\nConsidering the scale of the stablecoin market, it’s naive to neglect the reflexivity of the relationship between Ethena’s operations/supply and the aggregate ETH perp funding rate.\nThe in-sample backtest shown in the previous tweet simulates yield on $5b circulating $USDe supply. What’s not mentioned, however, is that $USDe would have represented roughly half of aggregate ETH open interest… the backtest is inherently flawed.\n\n\n\n\nAlthough it’s important to point out weakness of the backtest, this doesn’t necessarily suggest a point of failure for $USDe.\n\nThe design is fundamentally different from the UST-esque algostables, which were always necessarily destined to collapse. In fact, if Ethena’s mint & redemption process is both free and (near) instant, the $USDe mechanism can be inherently self-correcting.\nLet’s imagine the $USDe supply was $5b today, Ethena would represent nearly half of the $10b ETH perp open interest, and the funding rate would likely be negative (exact threshold for % of OI Ethena can be comfortable with is unclear, but 50% is probably unhealthy).\nWith transparent metrics on curculating supply, assets, liabilities, and distribution (what % of the shorts are on BitMex vs Bybit vs …), the market can observe collateral fluctuations, and react rationally. Users swap out of $USDe on Curve, which is purchased by market makers/arbitrageurs who then redeem with Ethena. This lifts the short pressure until the funding rate (or net yield, including stETH) is positive again.\n\nThere is certainly much more to be discussed.\n\n\nWhat can be done to further mitigate exchange risk, even if it’s only relevant to the short derivative leg?\nWhere will the “natural funding rate” converge with this mechanism implemented at scale?\nWhat role does the insurance fund play, and how shall it be sized/scaled optimally?\nCan the “internet bond” effectively offer an inversely correlated yield to bonds (think crypto OI/perp funding in bullish, low-rate environment vs high-rate)?\n\nBut I’ll end the thread here for now.\nThe @ethena_labs team is legit, and it’s clear they are continuing to diligence the relevant considerations. A bankless stablecoin is a pivotal instrument for the cryptoeconomy, and I look forward to further public engagement as this develops. https://twitter.com/leptokurtic_/status/1682781205811589120?s=20"

How much would you have to get paid to park your funds at Binance? 30%? 80%? This is a real question that CEX HFT shops and crypto VCs decide internally - the consensus is almost certainly above $USDe’s expected yield.\nThe only proper mitigation I see is to avoid custodying assets at the exchanges. Park the stETH in Fireblocks, Ledger, etc. and make special agreements with Binance, Bybit, Bitmex, etc. to accept this (likely some form of ZK-Proof of stETH asset claim) as collateral, and simply settle funding payments intermittently.\nThis doesn’t exactly eliminate all counterparty risk (still an operational nightmare/panic if Binance goes FTX mode), but it ensures assets are safu. I’m not sure this is actually Ethena’s plan, but it appears to be the only sufficient solution (assuming CEXs agree to the setup).\nTODO: Mention the black swan force exit short perps too (the BitMex event)? - Ethena redemption should have scaled down exposure in the hours and minutes prior to this event (funding will necessarily have been negative before the trigger) - Ethena is hedged across multiple CEXes (historically this happens on one exchange at a time) - Ethena insurance fund as final backstop\n6/ Addressing Basis Risk\nThe question/issue is what happens when (not if) the perp-spot spread flips, and the delta-neutral position begins to bleed (rather than accrue) funding payments.\n@leptokurtic gives the TLDR mitigation/assumptions here\nhttps://twitter.com/leptokurtic_/status/1682781081068769280?s=20\n7/ I will focus on one of Ethena’s core assumptions, specifically that the “natural funding rate” is positive.

The backtested yield in the previous tweet is under the assumption of $5b circulating $USDe supply - I predict this in-sample backtesting wil. This implies a $5b short OI, which is sustantial considering aggregate OI seen historically.\nThe image below shows Binance alone, but including Bybit, Bitmex, Derbit, and OKEx, total OI on ETH perpetual swaps is ~$TODO. Ethena would represent TODO% of ETH perp OI across all major exchanges.\n\n\n\nFix Up - not final\n9/ The question becomes: In the scenario wherein $USDe is widely adopted, what is the “natural funding rate” of ETH perps? Here’s a thesis:\nThe introduction of ETH staking, and liquid staking derivatives, effectively increased the baseline ETH lending rate (ETH’s LIBOR/SOFR) by the network’s staking yield. Why would anyone lend ETH at 80bps, when they can deposit for an LSD and earn 5% (where they can also then lend the LSD for 80bps)?\nThe “natural funding rate” baseline (not including the upwards skew cause by net bullish payment for leverage, which will remain a factor) on ETH perps will no longer necessarily == risk-free rate, as traditionally assumed for non-interest accruing assets (BTC, Gold, etc.). Instead, it will begin to additionally reflect the yield of ETH staking (risk-free rate - expected stETH yield). {{\n\n\n\n}}\n10/ Explain the logic - how other traders will arb funding rate considering availability of stETH as collateral. Why would this suggest a negative bias ~= eth yield.\nFin/ The team behind Ethena is legit. To their credit, it seems they are continuing to diligence this concern.

Founded in the early 1990s, the movement has been most active during the 1990s “cryptowars” and following the 2011 internet spring. The Cypherpunks forecasted the coming age of digital information, and saw cryptography as a means of preserving fundamental individual rights, such privacy and self-sovereignty. Members of this group include Roger Dingledine, co-founder of the Tor Project, Julian Assange, founder of Wikileaks, and perhaps most notably, Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin.\nMany of the protocols, algorithms, and applications developed by the Cypherpunks were centered around privacy.

    "section": "The Genesis Case Study, Bitcoin",
    "text": "The Genesis Case Study, Bitcoin\n\nPseudonymity != Anonymity\nIn October of 2008, an email from Satoshi Nakamoto was sent to the cypherpunk email list, titled “Bitcoin P2P e-cash paper”.\nParticipation in the Bitcoin network only requires a public/private keypair (ECDSA for Version 1). There is no support for “accounts” or “profiles” which include other metadata, such as name, email, address, etc. Thus, the Bitcoin network is inherently pseudonymous, where the pseudonyms are Bitcoin addresses (smaller hashed versions of the public key). On the Bitcoin network, all transactions are published to and stored on the public ledger (this allows for Bitcoin’s distributed consensus), making intra-network forensics trivial. I.e. it is trivial to retreive the entire financial history of 1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa, and verifiably gather information on all transactions involving this address, neighboring addresses, etc.\nStill, it remains theoretically possible to use Bitcoin anonymously. A Bitcoin user may rely on proper operational security (OpSec) techniques to ensure his/her Bitcoin pseudonym remains entirely disjunct from his/her “real” or government identity. In the early days of Bitcoin, the majority of participants did successfully maintain anonymity through proper OpSec - accessing the network through VPNs, public WiFi hotspots, remote SSH tunneling, etc.\nOne factor contributing to the early success of anonymity was the fact that the earliest users of Bitcoin were often well-versed in digital OpSec. Early users generated and custodied their keypairs on a local and/or secure machine because they were familiar with ECDSA encryption, and they executed Bitcoin payments under anonymous identities on secure e-commerce platforms, accessed through secure dark-web browsers, like Tor.\nAnother factor contributing to Bitcoin’s early privacy, however, is that the technology remained siloed in it’s earliest years, segregated from regulated financial infrastructure, and “under the radar” of intelligence organizations. For example, the creator and operator of one of the most prolific darknet Bitcoin marketplaces, the Silk Road, was identified and arrested in 2013, after just two years of successfully maintaining anonymity through pseudonymity.\nThe key realization here is that Bitcoin offers a permissionless and censorship-resistant method of transacting value - nothing else. In order to protect one’s identity in the applications of Bitcoin, one must rely on the other components of the technology stack to provide the privacy guarantees to maintain anonymity. Any if any single OpSec mistake were to be made, everything about the user’s pseudonym could be revealed.\nThe consequences of Bitcoin’s intra-network transparency were difficult to identify in its early life - Bitcoin seemed privacy-preserving. Fast-forward 13 years, however, and the ability to surveil couldn’t be more clear.\nAccording to recent reports, approximately 46 million Americans (~22% of US population) own some form of Bitcoin. Out of this, it’s estimated that at least 8/10 purchased and/or hold their Bitcoin through a KYC’d account on a custodied platform, such as Coinbase, Crypto[dot]com, or Robinhood. From this alone, the Bitcoin-specific financial information off nearly all US persons (not just the ones with KYC’d accounts) is effectively public. These entities are obligated to release Customer data if provoked on legal grounds, and sophisticated players can retreive this information even in the case Coinbase were to remain non-compliant.\nThe Bitcoin protocol, when integrated with 3rd party KYC applications (as it is today and will be throughout the foreseeable future), is a near-perfect protocol for financial surveillance."

Perhaps this was all part of Satoshi’s grand vision, and it is ethically optimal for financial settlement infrastructure to offer complete transparency. I will continue to avoid the question of good or bad as it pertains to Bitcoin, because I, myself, am not certain in my stance.\nWhen the question extends to Turing-Complete networks, however, I have enough convinction to argue that zero-privacy guarantees are suboptimal.\nIn 2014, a novel smart contract based, Turing-Complete blockchain protocol called Ethereum was introduced. Ethereum allowed for arbitrary code executions, enabling application development beyond just the transfer of the native asset. Over the past several years, there has been an explosion of Ethereum application development. From domain name services to gaming/social apps, these applications span beyond just payments - logging data, provoking external program executions, developing on-chain reputation/identity, and establishing organizational structures of accounts.\n\nPower tends to corrupt; absolute power corrupts absolutely\n\nJust like Bitcoin, all data associated with Ethereum transactions, by default, are stored on the public ledger in plaintext for anyone to view. With countless “decentralized” profile-based applications, the connection between an on-chain pseudonym and corresponding government identity is increasingly inevitable. Additionally, every action, transaction, and application interaction performed on Ethereum further develops the user’s on-chain reputation, permanently documented on Ethereum’s immutable global ledger. Even if the goal was not to maintain a distinction between on-chain and “real” identities, a lack of privacy for the on-chain identity inevitably approaches a lack of privacy in real life.\n\nCalling an Uber\nBuying an engagement ring (or organizing a surprise party)\nAny healthcare-related activites\n\nUpon meditating on the consequences of an extension of this paradigm, one may encounter a seemingly endless array of dystopian scenarios."

    "text": "Conclusion\nAs Vitalik Buterin voiced, the “Holy Grail” blockchain technology would allow users to benefit from the security of a blockchain, using a decentralized network to process the transactions, but “encrypting” the data in such a way that even though everything is being computed in plain sight, the underlying “meaning” of the information is completely obfuscated.\nToday’s blockchains lack privacy because distributed consensus mechanisms rely on the verifiability of blockchain data, which currently requires plaintext data. There exist exciting fields of cryptographic research in pursuit of solving this issue - my personal favorites are Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) and Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE).\nHowever, the integration of privacy-enabling primitives is time-sensitive. Deferring essential features to later appensions to the technology often results in weaker guarantees of the respective features. Additionally, as societal adoption increases over time, the community is more likely to become distanced from the ethos from which the technology was birthed.\n\nFrom my earliest days I had a passion for science. But science, the exercise of the supreme power of the human intellect, was always linked in my mind with benefit to people. I saw science as being in harmony with humanity. I did not imagine that the second half of my life would be spent on efforts to avert a mortal danger to humanity created by science.\n\nI hope the topic of privacy remains at the forefront of blockchain research. We must actively ensure that the innovation of distributed computing serves to benefit society: for this is not guaranteed."

One of the earliest dominant currencies was the Athenian silver tetradrachm, which gained dominance over the gold/silver coins issued by Persia and other western empires of the time. Aside from the economic success and naval hegemony of ancient Athens, factors contributing to the currency’s success were large circulating supply, fine quality, and unchanging appearance. Nevertheless, the “dominance” of Athenian money was limited, as dozens of currencies remained in use in local circulation.\n\n\nThe Rise of Rome, and the Globalization of Money\nFollowing the rise of the Roman Empire, the introduction of the Roman silver denarius around 211 B.C. marked a turning point in Western money. The denarius effectively fixed the previously-fluctuating relationship between silver and bronze, with one silver denarius (containing ~4.5g of silver) exchangeable for 10 bronze asses, (the as was a bronze coin of the time). Gold was used less frequently, until Julius Ceasar standardized the gold aureus (8g of gold) to 25 denarii. The success of Roman imperialism expanded adoption of the aureus/denarius/as standard farther than any currency prior. Rome effectively established the (Western) globalization of hard money.\nThese currencies and their respective exchange rates remained impressively stable through the turmoil caused by the assassination of Julius Ceasar in 44 B.C. Many historians credit the strength of Roman money as a crucial foundation for the 200-year golden age of Rome, known as the Pax Romana, which lasted from 27 B.C. to 170 A.D.\n\n\nCoin Clipping: The Beginning of the End\nAround the middle of the Pax Romana, however, Emperor Nero made a monetary decision that, in retrospect, appears to mark the beginning of the end of Roman economic prowess. When faced with increasing government expenditures, Emperor Nero became the first to engage in what is known as coin clipping: the emperor would recall the coins then mint them into a new coin with a lower metallic content but with the same face value. This is currency debasement - it marked the introduction of government-induced inflation in Rome.\nIt’s important to note that currency debasement proved to be successful in the short term. The decision to begin coin clipping may be responsible for successfully extending the period of Roman peace, as over the reign of the next several Emperors, economic prosperity and peace continued as inflation remained below half a percent.\nOver the next two hundred years, however, it became clear that the temporary relief provided by currency debasement (coin clipping) would eventually demand further debasement. Rome was permanently prohibited from returning to a non-inflationary economy, and thus engaged in a vicious cycle:\ncurrency debasement → price increases → price controls → further debasement\nIn the long run, coin clipping only increased the magnitude of the problems Emperor Nero set to solve. This cycle ravaged Rome through centuries of political and economic instability, until Constantine managed to restore stability through significant monetary reform.\n\n\nHard Money to the Rescue… Too Late\nConstantine issued the gold solidus in 312 A.D. at a weight of 4.55 grams, permanently replacing the aureus. The solidus was worth 275,000 debased denarii, which now contained ~5% silver, down from the original 95%.\nConstantine required the fixed weight of the solidus, without debasement, which finally established Roman economic stability.\nThe recovery of the Roman economy came too late, as continuing foreign invasions led to the collapse of the Western Roman Empire. However, the gold solidus was so successful that it remained the currency of the Byzantine Empire (Eastern Rome) centuries after the fall of the Western Empire.

    "text": "Thesis\nThe Russia x Ukraine conflict is a military-grade, organized psyop by global elites.\n\nThe War in Iraq: A Comparison\nTo appreciate the ability of economic incentives to motivate psychological operations aimed towards international conflict, I would like to bring up the a case study: the War in Iraq. much like the false claims of weapons of mass destruction which led to the previously unpopular invasion of Iraq.\n\n\nWEF New World Order: A Global Pandemic, then International Conflict\nOn March 27, 2018, the NIH-EcoHealth Alliance submitted a proposal to DARPA, requesting $14,209,245 in funding for Project DEFUSE: Defusing the Threat of Bat-borne Coronaviruses.\nExcerpt from Executive Summary, Technical Approach 1\n\nWe will sequence their spike proteins, reverse engineer them to conduct binding assays, and insert them into bat SARSr-CoV (WIV1, SHC014) backbones (these use bat-SARSr-CoV backbones, not SARS-CoV, and are exempt from dual-use and gain of function concerns) to infect humanized mice and assess capacity to cause SARS-like disease.\n\nIn an email to a US Marine Corps Captain (unidentified), Major Joe Murphy of the Office of Naval Research outlined some concerns that arose after he “came across additional incriminating documents and produced an analysis shortly after leaving DARPA last month.”\nIn the email to his superior, Major Joe Murphy explained the following.\n\nI’m unsure whether the significance of what I communicated is understood by those that received the report. Decisions with regards to the vaccines do not appear to be informed by analysis of the documents. The main points being that SARS-CoV-2 matches the SARS vaccine variants the NIH-EcoHealth program was making in Wuhan; that the DOD rejected the program proposal because vaccines would be ineffective and because the spike proteins being inserted into the variants were deemed too dangerous (gain-of-function); and that the DOD now mandates vaccines that copy the spike protein previously deemed too dangerous. To me, and to those who informed my analysis, this situation meets no-go or abort criteria with regards to the vaccines until the toxicity of the spike protein can be investigated. There’s also information within the documents about which drugs effectively treat the program’s SARS-CoVs.\n\nMajor Joe Murphy was correct. On August 13, 2021, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) unclassified a document with subject: SARS-CoV-2 Origins Investigation With US Government Program Undisclosed Document Analysis.\nIn this document, the Commandant of the Marine Corps Fellow, DARPA, states the following.\nExcerpt from Page 1\n\nSARS-CoV-2 is an American-created recombinant bat vaccine, or its precursor virus. It was created by an EcoHealth Alliance program at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV), as suggested by the reporting surrounding the lab leak hypothesis. The details of this program have been concealed since the pandemic began. These details can be found in the EcoHealth Alliance proposal response to the DARPA PREEMPT program Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) HR00118S0017, dqted March 2018 - a document not yet publicly disclosed.\n\nExcerpt from Page 2\n\nBecause of its (now) known nature, the SARs-CoV-WIV’s illness is readily resolved with early treatment that inhibits the viral replication that spreads the spike proteins around the body (which induce a harmful overactive immune response as the body tries to clear the spikes from the ACE2 receptors). Many of the early treatment protocols ignored by the authorities work because they inhibit viral replication or modulate the immune response to the spike proteins, which make sense within the context of what EcoHealth was creating. Some of these treatment protocols also inhibit the action of the engineered spike protein. For instance, Ivermectin (identified as curative April 2020) works throughout all phases of illness because it both inhibits viral replication and modulates the immune response. Of note, chloroqine phosphate (Hydroxychloroquine, identified April 2020 as curative) is identified in the proposal as a SARSr-CoV inhibitor, as is interferon (identified May 2020 as curative).\n\n\nThe gene-encoded, or “mRNA,” vaccines work poorly because they are synthetic replications of the already-synthetic SARSr-CoV-WIV spike proteins and posses no other epitopes. The mRNA instructs the cells to produce synthetic copies of the SARSr-CoV-WIV synthetic spike protein directly into the bloodstream, wherein they spread and produce the same ACE2 immun storm that the recombinant vaccine does.\n\n\nThe massive, “Manhattan-Project”-level of information suppression executed by the government and the Trusted News Initiative indicates that it would be covered-up if something bad happened. The lab-leak hypothesis and squabbling between Senator Paul and Dr. Fauci indicated that the cover up would be more disciplined in its paperwork. So I presumed that unclassified files would be concealed on a higher network and found them where I expected them to be. I understood what they were and their content, pushed the files off-site, and compiled this report.\n\n“\nThe proposal was rejected by the Department of Defense (DOD) in 2018 “because vaccines would be ineffective and because the spike proteins being inserted into the variants were deemed to dangerous (gain-of-function)…”\nIn November 2019, a Sars-COV-2 virus was identified just outside the Wuhan Institute of Virology. In 2018,\nBelow is an article wherein a member of the SPI-B, a subcomittee that advises the cientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), admits a regret of the use of fear as a dystopian measure of population control.\nThe Telegraph 20210514 Use of fear to control behaviour in Covid crisis was ‘totalitarian’, admit scientists - Document PDF.pdf"

    "section": "",
    "text": "There exist distinct risks related to AI. Each posing a different severity and relevant on a different timeline.\n\nBackground\nI’ve spent a some time meditating on this question. I have interacted with the industry as a consumer, as an investor, as a startup contributor, and as a (novice) developer. Most importantly, I’ve had fruitful discussions with, and have listened very carefully to, many people with more perspectives than I.\nThat’s not to say my views are necessarily important, or even correct - it’s just a bit of context. I remain open-minded, and I welcome discussion, counter-points, and new information…\nI see two main, distinct vectors of risk\n\nLoss of Human Dominance\nCentralization of Information Flow\n\n\n\nLoss of Human Dominance\nThe first and most focused on vector of risk is the danger of a(n) agent(s) which surpass(es) humans in intelligence & aptitude. This is the rogue AGI scenario. Humans have held the top spot for ~300,000 years, and no one is capable of predicting what would happen if/when that changes.\nThis is the vector addressed by “Pause Giant AI Experiments: An Open Letter”\nI believe this vector of risk is real, and it is tremendously dangerous.\n\nCybersecurity will become very tricky.\nMilitary applications will introduce existential threats\nDomestic use cases (surveillance, policing) will yield tremendous controversy\n\nIn my opinion, the day-to-day news stories/headlines draw too much attention and cause us to overestimate the short-term risks. Yet, the longer term horizon of this paradigm remain wildly under-appreciated. Regardless of the severity of this risk vector, a “pause” on AI will never happen.\nThis is an arms race.\n\n\nCentralization of Information Flow\nThe second vector of risk, which I believe is more relevant in the short-term, regards what’s being referred to as the “Moderation Layer”.\nThis risk is not about the AI agent itself. Rather, it concerns the humans & organizations that own these models and are responsible for regulating (or in the position to regulate) usage. Although discussion on the correct approach to regulation/moderation takes place, these often happen in the political realm, wherein a strictly two-dimensional tug-of-war stagnates.\nMain Question:\nWhat is the goal of the moderation layer, and why is it necessary?\n\n“To censor dangerous content”\n\nWhat exactly defines “dangerous”? Would a blanket definition of “dangerous” be acceptable? For example, allowing an AI explain how to enrich Uranium to a jihadist group can likely be considered dangerous. Allowing the AI to explain this to a group of PhD Chemical Engineers, on the other hand, is not as dangerous.\n\n“To censor offensive content”\n\nAll statements are offensive to some extent, so where exactly are we drawing the line? To what extent should we be tolerant in the name of free speech? “Offensive” is a spectrum - there is no statement that offends none. It becomes clear to ask, to what extent are we willing to restrict the freedom of thought to protect users from being offended?\n\n“To limit the spread of misinformation”\n\nI have an appreciation for the harm that AI can do with respect to proliferating false information. But if the past few years have taught us anything, it’s that “misinformation” is now synonymous with “I don’t like that information”.\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) like OpenAI’s GPT-4 are trained on billions of lines of text, extracted from the internet, from millions of (human) sources of various demographics, representing a vast array of perspectives.\nOpenAI’s moderation layer is built by less than 100 humans, nearly all of whom have a similar background and reside in Silicon Valley.\n\n“The political ideology of conversational AI”\n\n\nTo believe the latter is capable of mitigating the bias the former, in my humble opinion, is misled.\n\nSee GPT-4 System Card, the Appendix\n\nI am not claiming the former (the agent) is unbiased. LLMs are trained heavily on text from Reddit, for example, which has an overrepresentation of men than women. Further, as (almost) all training data is extracted from the internet, the information from which the AI model “learns” is inherently biased towards the digital world: internet users, citizens of first world countries, etc.\nMy current stance is that the moderation layer is necessary, but\n\nThe implementation details of the moderation layer must be transparent.\nGovernance of the moderation layer must be, to some extent, decentralized. At the very least, let us agree the power should not lie solely in the hands of 0.00000125% of the world’s population."

Specified unlawful activities are set forth in the statute and include over 200 types of U.S. crimes, from drug trafficking, terrorism, and fraud, to crimes traditionally associated with organised crime, and certain foreign crimes, as discussed below in question 1.3.\nThe government does not need to prove that the person conducting the money laundering transaction knew that the proceeds were from a specified form of illegal activity.\nKnowledge can be based on wilful blindness or conscious indifference – failure to inquire when faced with red flags for illegal activity. Additionally, knowledge can be based on a government “sting” or subterfuge, where government agents represent that funds are the proceeds of illegal activity.\nUnder Section 1956, the transaction can be: (1) with the intent to promote the carrying on of the specified unlawful activity; (2) with the intent to engage in U.S. tax evasion or to file a false tax return; (3) knowing the transaction is in whole or in part to disguise the nature, location, source, ownership or control of the proceeds of a specified unlawful activity; or (4) with the intent to avoid a transaction reporting requirement under federal or state law.\nSection 1956 also criminalises the transportation or transmission of funds or monetary instruments (cash or negotiable instruments or securities in bearer form): (1) with the intent to promote the carrying out of a specific unlawful activity; or (2) knowing the funds or monetary instruments represent the proceeds of a specified unlawful activity and the transmission or transportation is designed in whole or in part to conceal or disguise the nature, location, source, ownership or control of the proceeds of the specified unlawful activity.\nUnder Section 1957, it is a crime to knowingly engage in a financial transaction in property derived from specified unlawful activity through a U.S. bank or other “financial institution”, or a foreign bank (in an amount greater than $10,000). Financial institution is broadly defined with reference to the Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”) statutory definition of financial institution (31 U.S.C. § 5312(a)(2)), and includes not just banks but a wide range of other financial businesses, including securities broker-dealers, insurance companies, non-bank finance companies, and casinos."

    "text": "Portabello Mushrooms\nConsumption of the Agaricus species mushrooms has increased considerably in Japan as the Japanese have become accustomed to Western cooking. The Agaricus species mushroom contains hydrazine derivatives known as Agaritine.\n\nRisks\n\nFrom Paul Stamets\n\nPortabellos have a problem. All mushrooms should be cooked, and portabellos, in particular, should be cooked at high temperatures.\n\n\nThere is an unfortunate group of compounds called agaritines. Agaritines are hydrazines that are heat unstable, so the good news is, you should cook them, and if you cook them well, then those mushrooms are not a problem. If you don’t cook them well, then these hydrazines are potentially problematic.\n\n\nNow, nature’s a numbers game: so, there are beneficial compounds, that, in some balance, may outweigh the negative effects of the hydrazines, the agaratines in these mushrooms, but that jury is still out so to speak.\n\n\n\n\nAcademic Papers\nAgaritine from Agaricus blazei Murrill induces apoptosis in the leukemic cell line U937\n\nAgaritine, a compound found in the medicinal mushroom Agaricus blazei Murrill, induces apoptosis (programmed cell death) in the leukemic cell line U937.\nAgaritine treatment caused a dose-dependent increase in apoptosis in U937 cells, as measured by the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria and the activation of caspases.\nAgaritine also induced the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins, such as Bax and Fas, and inhibited the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins, such as Bcl-2.\nThese findings suggest that agaritine may have potential as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of leukemia.\nAgaritine treatment caused a significant increase in the number of apoptotic cells in U937 cultures, as measured by flow cytometry.\nAgaritine also induced the characteristic morphological changes of apoptosis, such as nuclear condensation and fragmentation.\nWestern blot analysis showed that agaritine treatment increased the expression of Bax and Fas, and decreased the expression of Bcl-2.\nThese findings suggest that agaritine may trigger apoptosis in U937 cells by activating caspases and upregulating pro-apoptotic proteins.\nThe authors of the paper concluded that agaritine may have potential as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of leukemia. However, further studies are needed to confirm these findings and to determine the optimal dose and schedule of agaritine treatment.\n\nQuantities of agaritine in mushrooms (Agaricus bisporus) and the carcinogenicity of mushroom methanol extracts on the mouse bladder epithelium\n\nAgaritine is a carcinogenic compound found in mushrooms, including Agaricus bisporus (white button mushrooms).\nThe authors of the paper measured the levels of agaritine in Agaricus bisporus mushrooms and found that the levels varied depending on the growing conditions.\nThe authors also found that methanol extracts of Agaricus bisporus mushrooms were carcinogenic to the mouse bladder epithelium.\nThese findings suggest that agaritine may be a risk factor for bladder cancer in humans.\nThe authors measured the levels of agaritine in Agaricus bisporus mushrooms grown in different conditions, including open fields, greenhouses, and dark rooms.\nThe levels of agaritine were highest in mushrooms grown in dark rooms, followed by mushrooms grown in greenhouses, and then mushrooms grown in open fields.\nThe authors also found that methanol extracts of Agaricus bisporus mushrooms were carcinogenic to the mouse bladder epithelium.\nThis was determined by the induction of tumors in the mouse bladder after treatment with the methanol extracts. The authors concluded that agaritine may be a risk factor for bladder cancer in humans.\n\nSynthetic and Naturally Occurring Hydrazines as Possible Cancer Causative Agents\n\nHydrazines are a class of compounds that have been shown to be carcinogenic in animals.\nSeveral synthetic hydrazines have been shown to cause cancer in humans, including 1,2-diethylhydrazine, 1,2-dinitrohydrazine, and 1,2-dibromohydrazine. Hydrazines are also found naturally in some foods, including mushrooms, tobacco, and fish.\nThere is some evidence that naturally occurring hydrazines may also be carcinogenic, but more research is needed to confirm this.\nThe authors of the paper conclude that hydrazines are a potential risk factor for cancer, and that further research is needed to determine the extent of this risk.\nThe authors reviewed the literature on hydrazines and cancer, and identified 19 synthetic hydrazines that have been shown to be carcinogenic in animals.\nThe authors also identified several naturally occurring hydrazines that have been found in foods, including agaritine, gyromitrin, and BMAA.\nThe authors concluded that hydrazines are a potential risk factor for cancer, and that further research is needed to determine the extent of this risk. It is important to note that this paper was published in 1975, and there has been some research on hydrazines and cancer since then. However, the authors’ conclusions are still valid, and further research is still needed to determine the extent of the risk of cancer from hydrazines.\n\nGenotoxicity of agaritine in the lacI transgenic mouse mutation assay: evaluation of the health risk of mushroom consumption\n\nGoogle Bard would not summarize this paper as it did for every other one (???)\n\n\nUsing a previously derived quantitative correlation between mutagenicity in the lacI test and carcinogenic potency, the carcinogenicity of agaritine in mushrooms was estimated: the average Swiss mushroom consumption of 4 g/day would be expected to contribute a lifetime cumulative cancer risk of about two cases per 100,000 lives.\n\nAttempted tumor induction with agaritine in mice."

    "text": "Fractional Calculus\nWhat is Fractional Calculus\nDifferential calculus was invented independently by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz and it was understood that the notion of the derivative of nth order, that is, applying the differentiation operation n times in succession, was meaningful. In a 1695 letter, l’Hopital asked Leibniz about the possibility that n could be something other than an integer, such as n=1/2. Leibniz responded that “It will lead to a paradox, from which one day useful consequences will be drawn.” Leibniz was correct, but it would not be centuries until it became clear just how correct he was.\nThis article will investigate the question of what it could possibly mean to do something like take a 1/2 order derivative, and so introduce the theory of the fractional calculus.\nSummary\nThe blog post discusses the concept of fractional calculus, a mathematical field that explores the idea of derivatives and integrals of non-integer order. The concept was first proposed by Gottfried Leibniz in a response to a question from l’Hopital about the possibility of a derivative of order 1/2. The post explains the theory behind fractional calculus, its properties, and its applications, using the Riemann-Liouville integral and derivative as examples.\n\nFractional Calculus: Fractional calculus is the branch of mathematical analysis that investigates the possibility of taking derivatives and integrals of any real number order, not just integer order.\nIntuition: The concept of fractional calculus arises from the idea of interpreting differentiation and integration as transformations that continuously transform a function into its nth derivative or antiderivative.\nFractional Integral and Derivative: The most natural place to start with fractional calculus is with Cauchy’s formula for repeated integration. The generalization of the factorial function in this formula is the gamma function, which allows for the definition of the left Riemann-Liouville integral, a valid operator for integration to fractional order.\nDifferintegral Operator: The differintegral operator is a combination of the fractional integral and derivative, which can continuously transform between functions.\nProperties: Fractional calculus has unique properties, such as nonlocality, which means that the value of a fractional derivative at a point depends on an entire range of values, not just that point. This property makes fractional calculus useful for modeling physical phenomena with memory effects. Fractional Derivatives of Basic Functions: The fractional derivatives of power functions, sine function, and exponential function are discussed.\nInterpretation: The interpretation of fractional operators in a geometric or physical sense is still an area of active research. Applications: An example of the application of fractional calculus is in solving the tautochrone problem, which involves finding a curve such that the time taken by a bead to slide down the curve is independent of the initial height.\nConclusion: Fractional calculus is a result of pushing the boundaries of existing theories to work with extreme or unusual cases. It is a field with potential for new discoveries in mathematics and science."

    "text": "Fourier Transformations\nThe Fourier Transform is a mathematical technique that transforms a function of time, a signal, into a function of frequency. It’s a way to represent a signal in terms of its constituent frequencies, much like a musical chord can be expressed as the amplitudes of its constituent notes.\nThe Fourier Transform can be applied to a wide variety of fields, including physics, engineering, signal processing, image analysis, and data compression.\nFormally, for a continuous signal, the Fourier Transform F(w) of a function f(t) is given by the integral:\nF(w) = ∫ f(t) e^-iwt dt\nHere:\n\nw is the frequency,\nt is time,\ni is the imaginary unit,\ne is the base of the natural logarithm,\nand ∫ denotes integration over all time from -∞ to +∞.\n\nThe inverse Fourier Transform, which transforms back from the frequency domain to the time domain, is given by:\nf(t) = (1/2π) ∫ F(w) e^iwt dw\nNote that in practice, many signals are discrete rather than continuous, and the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) or its faster version, the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), are used.\nThe Fourier Transform and its variants are used in a wide variety of applications. For example, in audio processing, it can be used to identify the different frequencies present in a sound. In image processing, it can be used for operations like blurring an image or removing noise. In physics, it can be used to solve differential equations."

    "text": "Timeline of AI\nHistory of Artificial Neural Networks\nDeep Learning History\n\n\n\nFrank Rosenblatt invented the perceptron, an algorithm for pattern recognition, which is essentially a single-layer neural network.\n\n\n\nShortly after, he went on to explore deeper, multilayer perceptrons. His MLPs had a non-learning first layer with randomized weights and an adaptive output layer. Although this was not yet deep learning, because only the last layer learned.\n\n\n\nSuccessful learning in deep feedforward network architectures started in 1965 in the Ukraine (back then the USSR) when Alexey Ivakhnenko & Valentin Lapa introduced the first general, working learning algorithms for deep MLPs with arbitrarily many hidden layers (already containing the now popular multiplicative gates). A paper of 1971 already described a deep learning net with 8 layers, trained by their highly cited method which was still popular in the new millennium, especially in Eastern Europe, where much of Machine Learning was born.\n\n\n\nIvakhnenko and Lapa (1965, see above) trained their deep networks layer by layer. In 1967, however, Shun-Ichi Amari suggested to train MLPs with many layers in non-incremental end-to-end fashion from scratch by stochastic gradient descent, a method proposed in 1951 by Robbins & Monro.\nAmari’s implementation (with his student Saito) learned internal representations in a five layer MLP with two modifiable layers, which was trained to classify non-linearily separable pattern classes.\n\n\n\nKunihiko Fukushima introduced rectified linear units (ReLUs) for NNs (1969). They are now widely used in CNNs and other NNs.\n\n\n\nSeppo Linnainmaa was the first to publish what’s now known as backpropagation, the famous algorithm for credit assignment in networks of differentiable nodes, also known as “reverse mode of automatic differentiation.” It is now the foundation of widely used NN software packages such as PyTorch and Google’s Tensorflow.\n\n\n\nAmari published a paper on Amari-Hopfield networks, which resemble what’s now known as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).\n\n\n\nComputer Vision was revolutionized in the 2010s by a particular feedforward NN called the convolutional NN (CNN). The basic CNN architecture with alternating convolutional and downsampling layers is due to Kunihiko Fukushima, 1979. He called it Neocognitron.\n\n\n\n\nThe Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry set aside $850 million for the Fifth generation computer project.\nThe UK began the £350 million Alvey project.\nDARPA founded the Strategic Computing Initiative and tripling its investment in AI between 1984 and 1988.\n\n\n\n\n\nPhysicist John Hopfield was able to prove that a form of neural network (now called a “Hopfield net”) could learn and process information in a completely new way. This built on the Amari-Hopfield network from Amari’s 1972 publication\n\n\n\n\nGeoffrey Hinton “godfather of AI” invented the idea of multilayered neural networks, with nodes and weights. Node takes inputs and weights of inputs, outputs a signal if sum &gt; 0. - 1985 | A Learning Algorithm for Boltzmann Machines - 1986 | Learning representations by back-propagating errors\n\n\n\nDavid E. Rumelhart demonstrated that backpropagation can yield useful internal representations in hidden layers of NNs. At least for supervised learning, backpropagation is generally more efficient than Amari’s above-mentioned deep learning through the more general SGD method (1967), which learned useful internal representations in NNs about 2 decades earlier\nFeng-hsiung Hsu begins development on Chess-playing expert system called ChipTest. In 1988 it was moved to IBM and renamed Deep Thought, and then renamed again in 1989 to Deep Blue.\n\n\n\nGenerative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are first published in 1990 in Munich under the moniker Artificial Curiosity. Two dueling NNs (a probabilistic generator and a predictor) are trying to maximize each other’s loss in a minimax game. The generator (called the controller) generates probabilistic outputs (using stochastic units like in the much later StyleGANs). The predictor (called the world model) sees the outputs of the controller and predicts environmental reactions to them. Using gradient descent, the predictor NN minimizes its error, while the generator NN tries to make outputs that maximize this error: one net’s loss is the other net’s gain\n\n\n\nJiirgen Schmidhuber published a paper describing an alternative to RNNs: A feedforward NN slowly learns by gradient descent to program the changes of the fast weights of another NN. Such Fast Weight Programmers (FWPs) can learn to memorize past data, too. In 1991, one of them computed its fast weight changes through additive outer products of self-invented activation patterns (now often called keys and values for self-attention). The very similar Transformers combine this with projections and softmax and are now widely used in natural language processing. For long input sequences, their efficiency was improved through Transformers with linearized self-attention whose core is formally equivalent to the 1991 Fast Weight Programmers.\n\n\n\nSepp Hochreiter and Jurgen Schmidhuber published Long Short-Term Memory, the most cited NN paper of the 20th century. A later milestone was the “vanilla LSTM architecture” with forget gate — the LSTM variant of 1999-2000 that everybody is using today, e.g., in Google’s Tensorflow. Alex was lead author of our first successful application of LSTM to speech (2004). 2005 saw the first publication of LSTM with full backpropagation through time and of bi-directional LSTM (now widely used).\nAlso in 1997, Deep Blue beats Gary Kasparov in chess.\n\n\n\nImageNet is created, a large visual database envisioned by Fei-Fei Li from Stanford University, who realized that the best machine learning algorithms wouldn’t work well if the data didn’t reflect the real world. For many, ImageNet was the catalyst for the AI boom of the 21st century.\n\n\n\nX (formerly Google X) is an American semi-secret research and development facility and organization founded by Google in January 2010. X has its headquarters about a mile and a half from Alphabet’s corporate headquarters, the Googleplex, in Mountain View, California\nDeepMind was founded in the UK by Demis Hassabis, Shane Legg and Mustafa Suleyman in September 2010.\n\n\n\nThe Google Brain project began in 2011 as a part-time research collaboration between Google fellow Jeff Dean, Google Researcher Greg Corrado, and Stanford University professor Andrew Ng. Google Brain started as a Google X project and became so successful that it was graduated back to Google: Astro Teller has said that Google Brain paid for the entire cost of Google X.\n\n\n\nGeoffrey Hinton tests artificial deep neural network on a widely used image recogniztion test, called ImageNet. AlexNet was the program, scored 75% success, way better than competitors. This generates a ton of hype, and sparks more funding/research in AI, particularly image recognition.\n\n\n\nIn 2013, Geoffrey Hinton was acquihired by Google."

Intended to be the reinforcement learning version of ImageNet.\n\n\n2017: Attention is All You Need\nThe Google Brain team publishes a paper titled Attention is All You Need, introducing the Transformer - which is now an essential ingredient in many cutting edge models, particularly LLMs.\nThe key innovation is the idea of self-attention, a mechanism that allows the model to selectively choose which parts of the input to pay attention to rather than using the entire input equally.\nTransformers address RNN limitations by replacing recurrance with self attention. This weighs the importance of different parts of the input without having to maintain internal state. Much easier to parallize, and eliminates vanishing & exploding gradient problem.\nAlso 2017, Tesla poaches deep learning expert Andrej Karpathy from OpenAI to be its new head of Autopilot Vision.\n\n\n2018\n\nOpenAI Charter is published, which is later cited upon holding back powerful models like GPT-2.\nElon leaves OpenAI In early 2018, Musk told Sam Altman, another OpenAI founder, that he believed the venture had fallen fatally behind Google, people familiar with the matter said. Musk proposed a possible solution: He would take control of OpenAI and run it himself.\n\nAltman and OpenAI’s other founders rejected Musk’s proposal. Musk, in turn, walked away from the company — and reneged on a massive planned donation. The fallout from that conflict, culminating in the announcement of Musk’s departure on Feb 20, 2018, would shape the industry that’s changing the world, and the company at the heart of it.\nFebruary 20, 2018 announcement that Elon is departing. In the same month, OpenAI switched cloud providers from Amazon to Google, signing an agreement to spend at least $63 million with the tech giant over the next two years.\n\n\n2019\n\nOpenAI shifts from nonprofit to ‘capped-profit’ to attract capital.\n\nJuly 2019, Microsoft invests $1 billion in OpenAI to develop AI technologies on Microsoft Azure.\n\n\n2020\nOctober 2020, GPT-3 is released.\n\n\nCont’d\nOpenAI debtus DALL-E, text-to-image.\nDecember 2022, ChatGPT\n\n\n2023\nJanuary 2023, Microsoft buys 49% of OpenAI at $29 billion valuation.\nMarch 14, 2023: GPT-4.\nMay 2023, Governance of superintelligence blog published\nJuly 24, 2023: Attention is off by One"

    "text": "The Saudi Connection, Summary\n\nPeople\nOmar al-Bayoumi\nThe FBI has received numerous reports… dating back to 1999, alleging that al-Bayoumi may be a Saudi intelligence officer. FBI files suggest that al-Bayoumi provided substantial assistance to hijackers Khalid al-Mihdhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi after they arrived in San Diego in 2000. During this same timeframe, al-Bayoumi had extensive contact with Saudie Government establishments in the United States and received financial support from a Saudi company affiliated with the Saudi Ministry of defense. That company reportedly had ties to Osama Bin Ladin and al-Qa’ida.\nAl-Bayoumi was receiving substantial sums of money from the Saudi Embassy in Washington, DC prior to the 9/11 attacks… this money was being funneled from accounts at Riggs Bank belonging to Haifa bin Faisal, the wife of the Saudi Ambassador to the United States, Bandar bin Sultan.\nFahad Al-Thumairy\nA Saudi government official who was assigned to the Saudi Consulate in Los Angeles prior to 9/11. “… worked for the Saudi government in the Department of Religious Affairs”. Al-Thumairy was later deported from the U.S. on suspicion of links to terrorism.\nOsama Bassnan\nBassnan may have been in contact with al-Mihdhar and al-Hazmi during their time in San Diego. He was a close associate of al-Bayoumi and Omar Bakarbashat, another one of the hijackers’ close associates. He told another individual that he met al-Hazmi through al-Bayoumi and later that he met two of the hijackers through al-Bayoumi. Bassnan has many ties to the Saudi government, including past employment by the Saudi Arabian Education Mission. FBI received reports from individuals in the Muslim community alleging that Bassnan might be a Saudi intelligence officer. According to a CIA memo Bassnan reportedly received funding and possibly a fake passport from Saudi Government officials. He and his wife received financial support from the Saudi Ambassador to the United States and his wife. He met with a member of the Saudi Royal Family in Houston in 2002 and received a significant amount of cash. FBI information indicates that Bassnan is an extremist and supporter of Osama Bin Ladin.\nAbdullah Bin Ladin\nAbdullah Bin Ladin claims to work for the Saudi Embassy in Washington, D.C. as an administrative officer. He is identified by the FBI as Osama Bin Ladin’s half brother.\nKhalid al-Mihdhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi\nHijackers on the pentagon flight.\nMusaed A. Al-Jarrah\nAbdullah Al Ajroush\n“…not aware of any contact Al Ajroush has had with the FBI”\n“PENTTBOM Investigation”\n\n\nFacts\nSeveral of the phone numbers found in the phone book of Abu Zubaida, a senior al-Qa’ida operative captured in Pakistan in March 2002, could be linked, at least indirectly, to phone numbers in the United States. One of those numbers is subscribed to by the ASPCOL Corporation. A November 18, 2002 FBI respoonse to the Joint Inquiry states that “CIA traces have revealed no direct links between numbers found in Zubaida’s phone book and numbers in the United States.” The number of a bodyguard at the Saudi Embassy in Washington, DC, was also found in Zubaida’s possesion."

Gauge groups are important in both classical and quantum field theories, as well as in the study of differential geometry and topology.\nIn the context of physics, gauge groups are used to describe the symmetries of a physical system. For example, in electromagnetism, the gauge group is the group of local phase transformations that leave the electromagnetic potential and field strength unchanged. Similarly, in the theory of the strong force, the gauge group is the group of local color transformations that leave the quark-gluon field strength unchanged.\nIn mathematics, gauge groups arise in the study of connections on vector bundles over a manifold. The gauge group is the group of transformations of the connection that leave the curvature of the connection invariant. These groups play an important role in the study of the topology and geometry of manifolds, and have applications in areas such as mathematical physics, algebraic geometry, and topology.\nOne of the key features of gauge groups is that the physical or mathematical properties of a system are invariant under gauge transformations. This means that different gauge choices can be made for the same physical or mathematical system, without affecting its essential properties. This property is known as gauge invariance and is a fundamental concept in many areas of physics and mathematics.\n\n\n\nThe Yang-Mills theory is a quantum field theory that describes the behavior of particles known as gauge bosons, which mediate the strong nuclear force. The theory is based on the idea of local gauge symmetry, which means that the fundamental equations of the theory are invariant under certain transformations of the fields that describe the particles.\nThe Yang-Mills equations describe the behavior of the gauge bosons, which are particles that transmit the strong force between quarks. The equations involve a set of mathematical terms that describe the interactions between the gauge bosons and the quarks.\nThe Yang-Mills equations are based on a set of mathematical objects known as gauge fields, which describe the behavior of the gauge bosons. The gauge fields are represented by a set of matrices, which are used to calculate the interactions between the gauge bosons and the quarks.\nThe equations are formulated using the mathematical concept of a gauge group, which describes the possible transformations that can be made to the gauge fields. In the case of the strong force, the gauge group is called SU(3), which stands for special unitary group of degree 3.\nThe Yang-Mills equations involve two terms: the kinetic term and the interaction term. The kinetic term describes the free motion of the gauge bosons, while the interaction term describes the interactions between the gauge bosons and the quarks.\nThe kinetic term involves the gauge field strength tensor, which is a mathematical object that describes the strength of the gauge field at each point in spacetime. The interaction term involves the coupling constant, which is a parameter that describes the strength of the interaction between the gauge bosons and the quarks.\nThe Yang-Mills equations are highly non-linear and require advanced mathematical techniques to solve. They are also closely related to the concept of gauge invariance, which means that the equations are invariant under certain transformations of the gauge fields.\nOverall, the Yang-Mills theory provides a mathematical framework for describing the behavior of the strong nuclear force, which is one of the four fundamental forces of nature. The theory has been extensively tested and is an important component of the Standard Model of particle physics, which describes the behavior of all known elementary particles and their interactions."

His MLPs had a non-learning first layer with randomized weights and an adaptive output layer.

A paper of 1971 already described a deep learning net with 8 layers, trained by their highly cited method which was still popular in the new millennium, especially in Eastern Europe, where much of Machine Learning was born.\n\n\n\nIvakhnenko and Lapa (1965, see above) trained their deep networks layer by layer. In 1967, however, Shun-Ichi Amari suggested to train MLPs with many layers in non-incremental end-to-end fashion from scratch by stochastic gradient descent, a method proposed in 1951 by Robbins & Monro.\nAmari’s implementation (with his student Saito) learned internal representations in a five layer MLP with two modifiable layers, which was trained to classify non-linearily separable pattern classes.\n\n\n\nKunihiko Fukushima introduced rectified linear units (ReLUs) for NNs (1969).

Using gradient descent, the predictor NN minimizes its error, while the generator NN tries to make outputs that maximize this error: one net’s loss is the other net’s gain\n\n\n\nJiirgen Schmidhuber published a paper describing an alternative to RNNs: A feedforward NN slowly learns by gradient descent to program the changes of the fast weights of another NN. Such Fast Weight Programmers (FWPs) can learn to memorize past data, too.

Intended to be the reinforcement learning version of ImageNet.\n\n\n2017: Attention is All You Need\nThe Google Brain team publishes a paper titled Attention is All You Need, introducing the Transformer - which is now an essential ingredient in many cutting edge models, particularly LLMs.\nThe key innovation is the idea of self-attention, a mechanism that allows the model to selectively choose which parts of the input to pay attention to rather than using the entire input equally.\nTransformers address RNN limitations by replacing recurrance with self attention. This weighs the importance of different parts of the input without having to maintain internal state. Much easier to parallize, and eliminates vanishing & exploding gradient problem.\nAlso 2017, Tesla poaches deep learning expert Andrej Karpathy from OpenAI to be its new head of Autopilot Vision.\n\n\n2018\n\nOpenAI Charter is published, which is later cited upon holding back powerful models like GPT-2.\nElon leaves OpenAI In early 2018, Musk told Sam Altman, another OpenAI founder, that he believed the venture had fallen fatally behind Google, people familiar with the matter said. Musk proposed a possible solution: He would take control of OpenAI and run it himself.\n\nAltman and OpenAI’s other founders rejected Musk’s proposal. Musk, in turn, walked away from the company — and reneged on a massive planned donation. The fallout from that conflict, culminating in the announcement of Musk’s departure on Feb 20, 2018, would shape the industry that’s changing the world, and the company at the heart of it.\nFebruary 20, 2018 announcement that Elon is departing.

The concept was first proposed by Gottfried Leibniz in a response to a question from l’Hopital about the possibility of a derivative of order 1/2. The post explains the theory behind fractional calculus, its properties, and its applications, using the Riemann-Liouville integral and derivative as examples.\n\nFractional Calculus: Fractional calculus is the branch of mathematical analysis that investigates the possibility of taking derivatives and integrals of any real number order, not just integer order.\nIntuition: The concept of fractional calculus arises from the idea of interpreting differentiation and integration as transformations that continuously transform a function into its nth derivative or antiderivative.\nFractional Integral and Derivative: The most natural place to start with fractional calculus is with Cauchy’s formula for repeated integration. The generalization of the factorial function in this formula is the gamma function, which allows for the definition of the left Riemann-Liouville integral, a valid operator for integration to fractional order.\nDifferintegral Operator: The differintegral operator is a combination of the fractional integral and derivative, which can continuously transform between functions.\nProperties: Fractional calculus has unique properties, such as nonlocality, which means that the value of a fractional derivative at a point depends on an entire range of values, not just that point. This property makes fractional calculus useful for modeling physical phenomena with memory effects.\nFractional Derivatives of Basic Functions: The fractional derivatives of power functions, sine function, and exponential function are discussed.\nInterpretation: The interpretation of fractional operators in a geometric or physical sense is still an area of active research.\nApplications: An example of the application of fractional calculus is in solving the tautochrone problem, which involves finding a curve such that the time taken by a bead to slide down the curve is independent of the initial height.\nConclusion: Fractional calculus is a result of pushing the boundaries of existing theories to work with extreme or unusual cases. It is a field with potential for new discoveries in mathematics and science."

Scientists have discovered new forms of synchronization, called chimeras, that are more complex and intricate than previously known patterns. Chimeras are characterized by the coexistence of synchronized and unsynchronized regions in a single system. The discovery of chimeras has opened up new possibilities for understanding and controlling synchronization in a wide range of real-world systems. For example, chimeras could be used to design new communication networks that are more robust to noise and disruptions. The article also discusses the history of synchronization research and the challenges that scientists face in understanding and predicting the behavior of synchronized systems. It concludes by discussing the potential applications of chimeras in a variety of fields, including biology, engineering, and economics.\nThe discovery of chimeras was made possible by advances in computational power and mathematical modeling. Chimeras have been observed in a variety of natural systems, including fireflies, heart cells, and neural networks. Scientists are still learning about the rules that govern the formation and behavior of chimeras. Chimeras have the potential to be used to design new communication networks, control traffic flow, and improve the efficiency of energy systems.\n\n\nFourier Transformations\nThe Fourier Transform is a mathematical technique that transforms a function of time, a signal, into a function of frequency. It’s a way to represent a signal in terms of its constituent frequencies, much like a musical chord can be expressed as the amplitudes of its constituent notes.\nThe Fourier Transform can be applied to a wide variety of fields, including physics, engineering, signal processing, image analysis, and data compression.\nFormally, for a continuous signal, the Fourier Transform F(w) of a function f(t) is given by the integral:\nF(w) = ∫ f(t) e^-iwt dt\nHere:\n\nw is the frequency,\nt is time,\ni is the imaginary unit,\ne is the base of the natural logarithm,\nand ∫ denotes integration over all time from -∞ to +∞.\n\nThe inverse Fourier Transform, which transforms back from the frequency domain to the time domain, is given by:\nf(t) = (1/2π) ∫ F(w) e^iwt dw\nNote that in practice, many signals are discrete rather than continuous, and the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) or its faster version, the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), are used.\nThe Fourier Transform and its variants are used in a wide variety of applications. For example, in audio processing, it can be used to identify the different frequencies present in a sound. In image processing, it can be used for operations like blurring an image or removing noise. In physics, it can be used to solve differential equations."

In every reference frame the light speed is the same, so “in the reference frame of light” makes no sense because there time is stopped. The EH can’t be seen on oo because for an observer between PS and EH there are a finite number of oscillations of his time reference from PS to EH The assumption that the universe could rotate leads to a complication of all physical laws. We would get that there then has to be a rotation axis of the universe and that all rules are different with relation to that axis so that speed along the rotation direction can exceed c with any multiple without problems of inertia. This is similar to the Hubble expansion with the difference of an absolute rotation axis. That is why I reject both assumptions. It makes no sense to assume that space rotates. We rotate inside space. It also makes no sense to assume that space expands. We shrink inside space. The big one, space, is invariant, flat, not rotating, not translating, not curving. The small, what is inside space, rotates, translates, changes size. The only property of space that has a variation is that the propagation speed of light depends on the mass/energy density distribution in space.\n\n\nIsn’t it easier for Hawking radiation to escape if black holes have hair? So it’s not perfectly curved there. How does this equation differ from the superfluid quantum gravity spinning vortice(s) model of black holes?\n\n\n@bgreene marveled about the beauty of the equation. He didn’t gave a judgement about its validity. I gave an explanation on what assumptions are needed to allow this metric equation to be applicable. You come with the concept of a radiating BH. That only asks wether a particle pair of matter and antimatter could split such that one falks into, and one escapes the BH. But since the propagation speed of light at the EH is equal to the EH nothing moves there. So a hairy EH would assume that this propagation speed distribution is not smooth.

In the talk, he explores this question by analyzing the ups and downs of quantum field theory throughout its history.\nSummary\nQuantum Field Theory was born just pertaining to the electromagnetic field. When expanding this theory, it seemed it couldn’t be trusted at high energies. In the late 1940s, there was a new optimizing with the invention of a relatavistic perturbation theory, where the infinities could be absorbed into a redefinition of parameters like mass and charge of the electron. People thought this was sweeping problems under the rug, but it also may have been a way of selecting good theories (renormalizable theories). For example, theere’s nothing in the symmetries of quantum electrodynamics which rules out putting a term in the field equations (or Lagrangian), which could make the magnetic moment of the electron anything you want. This would make the mass of the electron -1, which means the theory is not renormalizable, and thus shows invalid.\nIn the late 1960s and early 70s, the standard model came to fruition - this was the renaissance of Quantum Field theory. But there were still doubts whether this was a fundamental theory or an effective one.\nQuantum Field Theory & Einsteinian Physics may be low energy approximations of a more fundamental theory."

    "section": "Geometric Unity",
    "text": "Geometric Unity\n\nContext\nThis is notes on a lecture by Eric Weinstein on the topic of geometric unity. The lecture is available here.\nI am first watching this lecture without a proper background in tensor calculus, dirac notation, or differential geometry. My plan is first to listen, ponder curiously, explore the topics which I need to learn, and return once I’m able to independently generate an opinion with conviction.\n\n\nThe Current Idea of Physics\nEdward Witten gave 3 main insights/assumptions, they correspond to the 3 great equations\n(1) Physics takes place in an arena\nThat arena is a manifold x together with some kind of semi-Riemannian metric structure: something that allows us to take length and angle, so that we can perform measurements at everypoint in spacetime or higher dimensional structure.\nThe equation associated with this is the Einstein Field Equation.\n\\[ R_{\\mu\\nu} - \\frac{1}{2} R g_{\\mu\\nu} + \\Lambda g_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{8 \\pi G}{c^4} T_{\\mu\\nu} \\]\n\n\\(R_{\\mu\\nu}\\) is the Ricci tensor, which encodes information about the curvature of spacetime.\n\\(R\\) is the Ricci scalar, a measure of the overall curvature of spacetime.\n\\(g_{\\mu\\nu}\\) is the metric tensor, which describes the geometry of spacetime.\n\\(\\Lambda\\) is the cosmological constant, which represents the energy density of the vacuum of space.\n\\(G\\) is the gravitational constant, which determines the strength of the gravitational interaction.\n\\(c\\) is the speed of light in vacuum, which sets the scale for the relationship between space and time.\n\\(T_{\\mu\\nu}\\) is the stress-energy tensor, which describes the distribution of matter and energy in spacetime.\n\n(2) Symmetry groups are fundamental. They cannot be deduced from any structure inside the arena. They are additional data that come to us “out of the blue”, wihtout any explanation. These symmetries create a non-abelian group, which is currently:\n\\[\\mathrm{SU}(3) \\times \\mathrm{SU}(2) \\times \\mathrm{U}(1)\\]\ndef. non-abelian group: sometimes called a non-commutative group, is a group in which there exists at least one pair of elements a and b of G, such that a ∗ b ≠ b ∗ a.\nThis has a corresponding curvature equation, that says the curvature of an auxillary structure known as a guage potential, when differentiated in a particular way, is again equal to “the amount of stuff in the system that is not directly involved in the equation above”.\n\\[d^*_A F_A = J(\\psi)\\]\n\n\\(d_A\\) is the exterior covariant derivative associated with the connection A. It is a generalization of the standard exterior derivative to take into account the nontrivial connection structure of the gauge field.\n\\(F_A\\) is the curvature 2-form of the connection A. It encodes the non-Abelian nature of the gauge field and is given by the commutator of the connection 1-forms.\n\\(d_A^*\\) is the adjoint of the exterior covariant derivative, known as the codifferential. It maps p-forms to (p-1)-forms and is defined with respect to the metric on the underlying spacetime manifold.\n\\(J(\\psi)\\) is the source term associated with a spinor field ψ. It is usually expressed in terms of the Dirac equation, which relates the spinor ψ to a massless field that obeys the wave equation. The source term J encodes the coupling of the spinor to the gauge field, and in the case of the electromagnetic field, it is proportional to the electric charge of the particle.\n\nThe equation \\(d_A^* F_A = J(\\psi)\\) is a local differential equation that relates the curvature of a gauge field to the sources that generate it. It is a key ingredient in the formulation of gauge theories such as quantum chromodynamics and the electroweak theory, which describe the strong and electroweak interactions in particle physics. It also has applications in other areas of physics, such as condensed matter physics and general relativity.\n(3) Matter is assymetric and therefore light.\nWe have a Dirac equation coupled to a connection\n\\[ \\phi_A \\psi = \\mu \\psi \\]\n\nIn this equation, \\(\\psi\\) is a spinor field and \\(\\phi_A\\) is a differential operator that acts on \\(\\psi\\). The index \\(A\\) can represent different kinds of symmetry groups, such as the gauge group in a gauge theory. The equation states that the action of the operator \\(\\phi_A\\) on the spinor field \\(\\psi\\) yields a scalar multiple of \\(\\psi\\) with eigenvalue \\(\\mu\\). In other words, \\(\\psi\\) is an eigenvector of \\(\\phi_A\\) with eigenvalue \\(\\mu\\).\n\n\nThis equation has applications in several areas of physics, such as quantum field theory and condensed matter physics. For example, in condensed matter physics, \\(\\phi_A\\) can represent the Hamiltonian of a system, and \\(\\psi\\) can represent a wave function that describes the state of the system. The equation then describes how the system evolves over time.\n\nOne of the great insights: the reason for the lightness of matter in the natural mass scale of physics has to do with the fact that the psi should have 2 components and the differential operator should map to one component on the other side fo the equation but the mass operator should map to another. So if one of the components is missing, if the equation is intrinsically lobsided (ciral / assymetric), then the amss term and the differential term have difficulty interacting, which is overcompensating for the mass scale of the universe so you get to a point where you have to define a massless equation. Just like overshooting a putt, it’s easier to knock it back by putting in a Higgs Field in order to generate an “as-if” fundamental mass through the Yukawa couplings.\nEdward Witten went on to say one more thing\nThese three central observations must be supplemented by the idea that this all takes place in quantum mechanical fashion (or quantum field theoretic).\nIt’s more an after-market assumption rather than one of the core insights.\n\n\nEric’s Differences with the Community\nIs the quantum in good enough shape that we don’t know if we have a serious quantum mechanical problem or not. We know we have a quantum field problem relative to the current formulation of these theories, but we also know in other cases the quantum becomes incredible natural (sometimes almost magically). We don’t know if the true theories (the ones we need to be generalizing in some sense) have beautiful quantum mechanical treatments, whereas some of the effective theories we are dealing with now may not survive the quantumization.\nImagine a different sort of incompatability. Take the 3 theories and treat them as 3 vertices of a triangle.\n\nEinstein GR\nDirac\nYang, Mills, Maxwell, Anderson, Higgs\n\nLet’s explore the incompatabilities, not at the quantum level, but the geometric input. All 3 of these are geometric theories. What if the incompatability is at the geometry level before the theory is treated quantum mechanically?\nEinstein: We can rewrite by saying there is a\nTODO, ending here for now\n\n\nResponse & Discussion\n\nTimothy Nguyen and Theo Polya’s Response to GU"

These fluids could be plasma, liquid metals, or even seawater. MHD is a synthesis of fluid dynamics and electromagnetism.\nThe governing equations of MHD are the Navier-Stokes equations (in the limit of high Reynolds number) coupled with Maxwell’s equations. In the ideal MHD approximation, effects such as resistivity and viscosity are neglected, leading to a relatively simple set of governing equations:\n\nContinuity Equation: This equation ensures the conservation of mass.\n∂ρ/∂t + ∇·(ρv) = 0\nMomentum Equation: Combines Newton’s second law and the Lorentz force, accounting for the forces due to pressure gradients, gravity, and electromagnetic fields. In the absence of viscosity, this simplifies to:\nρ(∂v/∂t + v·∇v) = -∇p + ρg + (J×B)\nInduction Equation: Describes how the magnetic field evolves over time, given the fluid’s velocity and existing magnetic field.\n∂B/∂t = ∇×(v×B)\nEnergy Equation: This equation describes the conservation of energy, which is usually taken in the form of the first law of thermodynamics.\nAmpère’s Law with Maxwell’s Addition:\n∇×B = μ0J\nJ is the current density vector, B is the magnetic field, and μ0 is the magnetic permeability.\n\nIn these equations, ρ represents fluid density, v fluid velocity, p pressure, g gravitational acceleration, J current density, and B magnetic field.\nMHD has a wide range of applications, from studying astrophysical phenomena such as solar flares and accretion disks, to engineering applications like nuclear fusion research, liquid metal cooling in reactors, and even potential propulsion systems.\nHowever, real-world situations often involve non-ideal MHD where effects such as resistivity cannot be ignored. Understanding these effects often requires incorporating the full set of Maxwell’s equations and solving them alongside the fluid dynamics equations, which makes for a much more complex computational problem. In some non-ideal MHD scenarios, magnetic reconnection, turbulence, and other instabilities can occur, which are active research areas in this field."

The result is the unhindered flow of electric current, manifesting remarkable properties such as zero resistance and perfect diamagnetism. Initially discovered in simple elements like lead and mercury, superconducting properties have since been found in various alloys and complex materials.\nThe phenomenon of superconductivity was first discovered by Dutch physicist Heike Kamerlingh Onnes in 1911 while experimenting with mercury at temperatures close to absolute zero. Subsequent decades led to the development of multiple theories, with John Bardeen, Leon Cooper, and John Schrieffer collectively proposing the BCS Theory in 1957. This theory described how electrons form “Cooper pairs” in a lattice, facilitating the zero-resistance state. In 1986, the discovery of high-temperature superconductors by Georg Bednorz and K. Alex Müller ushered in renewed interest and research because these materials could superconduct at temperatures much higher than those required for simple elements.\nSuperconductivity is highly important because of its transformative implications for energy transmission and storage. Its properties can potentially revolutionize fields ranging from transportation to medical technology. Because superconductors exhibit zero electrical resistance, they offer the potential for incredibly efficient energy transmission systems, minimizing energy loss.\nApplications\n\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI): Superconducting magnets are fundamental to the high-resolution imaging achievable in modern MRI machines.\nMaglev Trains: Magnetic levitation (Maglev) trains use superconducting magnets for frictionless, high-speed travel.\nParticle Accelerators: Superconductors are crucial for the powerful magnets in particle accelerators like the Large Hadron Collider.\nPower Grids: Superconducting cables can dramatically increase the efficiency of power transmission.\nQuantum Computing: Superconducting circuits form the basis for some types of quantum bits, or “qubits,” central to quantum computing.\n\nRelevant Subtopics\n\nType I and Type II Superconductors: Type I superconductors are pure elements that expel all magnetic fields, whereas Type II superconductors are typically compounds or alloys that allow some penetration of magnetic fields.\nCooper Pairs: Understanding how electrons pair up to move through the lattice structure of superconductors without scattering is essential to understanding the phenomenon.\nBCS Theory: Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer Theory is the quantum mechanical explanation for superconductivity in conventional superconductors.\nHigh-Temperature Superconductors: These materials can superconduct at temperatures much higher than conventional superconductors, albeit still at very low temperatures by everyday standards.\nJosephson Junctions: These are thin insulating barriers or weak links between superconductors, and they exhibit unique quantum behaviors.\nVortices in Type II Superconductors: When magnetic fields penetrate a Type II superconductor, they do so at discrete points and form vortices, which has its own area of study and applications.\nApplications and Devices: From SQUIDs (Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices) to fault current limiters, many devices utilize superconducting properties for various applications."

    "text": "My Encounters - as a Physicist - with Mathematics\n\n\n\nDonaldson theory is a branch of mathematics that is concerned with the topology of four-dimensional manifolds. It is named after Simon Donaldson, a British mathematician who made significant contributions to the field in the 1980s.\nThe central problem in Donaldson theory is to understand the topology of four-dimensional manifolds using differential geometry and algebraic topology. Specifically, the theory focuses on the study of vector bundles and connections on these manifolds, and how they can be used to classify different types of four-dimensional manifolds.\nOne of the key results in Donaldson theory is Donaldson’s theorem, which states that the intersection form of a smooth, closed, simply-connected four-dimensional manifold can be recovered from its Seiberg-Witten invariants. The Seiberg-Witten invariants are a set of numbers that can be associated with a four-dimensional manifold and its spin-c structure. They were introduced by Edward Witten and Nathan Seiberg in the mid-1990s and have proven to be a powerful tool in the study of four-dimensional manifolds.\nDonaldson theory has applications in a variety of fields, including physics, where it has been used to study the topology of spacetime in string theory and other areas of theoretical physics. It has also had significant impact in pure mathematics, inspiring further research in the fields of algebraic geometry, topology, and differential geometry.\n\n\n\n\nLie Algebras in Particle Physics\n\nLie Algebras in particle physics are mathematical structures that help to describe and classify physical systems, particularly those involving symmetries and transformations. In essence, a Lie algebra is a vector space equipped with a certain kind of product, called the Lie bracket, that captures the essential information about continuous transformations and symmetries. When applied to particle physics, Lie algebras offer a robust framework for understanding the fundamental particles and forces that govern the universe.\nThe concept of Lie algebras originated in the late 19th century with the work of Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie. Originally developed to study continuous transformation groups, the scope of Lie algebras has expanded to diverse areas of mathematics and physics. Their application in particle physics became increasingly significant during the 20th century, especially after the development of quantum mechanics and quantum field theory. The SU(3) Lie algebra, for example, was crucial in predicting the existence of particles like the omega-minus baryon before it was experimentally discovered.\nLie algebras offer a theoretical structure that is essential for formulating the Standard Model of particle physics, which describes electromagnetic, weak, and strong forces. Because Lie algebras are tightly connected to symmetry principles, they enable physicists to simplify complex systems and make predictions about particle interactions.\nApplications\n\nParticle Classification: Used for the classification of elementary particles into families and generations, assisting in the prediction of undiscovered particles.\nSymmetry Breaking: Helps in understanding the mechanism by which symmetry breaking occurs, a phenomenon critical to our understanding of the universe.\nField Theories: Employed in various quantum field theories to solve or approximate solutions for complex equations of motion.\nUnification Theories: Lie algebras and their corresponding Lie groups have been essential in attempts to develop Grand Unified Theories (GUTs) and even theories of everything.\n\nRelevant Subtopics\n\nBasic Definitions and Principles: Introduction to Lie groups, Lie algebras, and the relationship between them.\nRepresentation Theory: How Lie algebras can be represented as matrices, and why these representations are useful in particle physics.\nSU(N) Algebras: Special Unitary Groups of degree (N) and their importance in particle physics.\nSymmetry and Conservation Laws: Discussion on how Lie algebras relate to symmetries in physical systems and the corresponding conservation laws.\nApplication to the Standard Model: Utilizing Lie algebras to describe the particles and interactions within the Standard Model.\nAdvanced Topics: Covering roots, weights, Dynkin diagrams, and their role in particle physics."

Thus then spacetime gets extremly curved. But if we assume that spacetime remains flat, then we have to rewrite this as what is the local light propagation velocity tensor. Under that assumption this velocity will become equal to the EH surface for a location at the EH. Because still remains valid that nothing can exceed the local speed of light, this means that all matter will come at rest at the EH with every particle wave function frozen on that surface. Nothing ever traverses the EH. All accumulates on it. The BH grows by accumulating frozen matter at its EH surface.\nExactly. In other words, if you take the reference frame of light, you’ll see that the EH is pushed to oo, and all matter will be contained between the photon horizon (r=3M) and the EH (r=2M). (Is our universe rotating?)\nYou can’t take the reference frame of light. In every reference frame the light speed is the same, so “in the reference frame of light” makes no sense because there time is stopped. The EH can’t be seen on oo because for an observer between PS and EH there are a finite number of oscillations of his time reference from PS to EH. The assumption that the universe could rotate leads to a complication of all physical laws. We would get that there then has to be a rotation axis of the universe and that all rules are different with relation to that axis so that speed along the rotation direction can exceed c with any multiple without problems of inertia. This is similar to the Hubble expansion with the difference of an absolute rotation axis. That is why I reject both assumptions. It makes no sense to assume that space rotates. We rotate inside space. It also makes no sense to assume that space expands. We shrink inside space. The big one, space, is invariant, flat, not rotating, not translating, not curving. The small, what is inside space, rotates, translates, changes size. The only property of space that has a variation is that the propagation speed of light depends on the mass/energy density distribution in space.\nIsn’t it easier for Hawking radiation to escape if black holes have hair? So it’s not perfectly curved there. How does this equation differ from the superfluid quantum gravity spinning vortice(s) model of black holes?\n@bgreene marveled about the beauty of the equation. He didn’t gave a judgement about its validity. I gave an explanation on what assumptions are needed to allow this metric equation to be applicable. You come with the concept of a radiating BH. That only asks wether a particle pair of matter and antimatter could split such that one falks into, and one escapes the BH. But since the propagation speed of light at the EH is equal to the EH nothing moves there. So a hairy EH would assume that this propagation speed distribution is not smooth. This then should lead to particle wave functions to start from “stand still” and move outward. Such phenomen would need a different metric equation, but would not alter the beauty of the equation that @bgreene mentioned."

While creating such a VM is a non-trivial task and demands deep integration between software and hardware, the potential benefits in terms of performance, security, and portability make it a compelling direction for the future of AI infrastructure.\nAs of my last update in September 2021, there isn’t a mainstream “virtual machine” tailored explicitly for GPUs in the same way that the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) or the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) are for their respective domains. However, there are platforms and runtime environments optimized for GPU operations, especially in the context of AI/ML.\nSome of these platforms and their unique features include:\n\nCUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture):\n\nDeveloper & Manufacturer: NVIDIA\nUnique Features:\n\nProvides a parallel computing platform and API model.\nIncorporates the CUDA Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) and the parallel compute engine in NVIDIA GPUs.\nSupports various high-level programming languages like C, C++, and Fortran.\n\nUse Cases: General GPU-accelerated computing, scientific simulations, deep learning training & inference.\n\nTensorRT:\n\nDeveloper & Manufacturer: NVIDIA\nUnique Features:\n\nHigh-performance deep learning inference optimizer and runtime.\nReduces the model size for faster inferencing.\nProvides INT8 and FP16 optimizations for production deployments.\n\nUse Cases: Optimizing and deploying deep learning models for production environments, especially on NVIDIA GPUs.\n\nROCm (Radeon Open Compute):\n\nDeveloper & Manufacturer: AMD\nUnique Features:\n\nOpen-source platform for GPU-enabled HPC (High Performance Computing) computing.\nSupports a range of machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch.\n\nUse Cases: GPU-accelerated computing on AMD GPUs, scientific simulations, AI/ML training & inference.\n\nDirectML:\n\nDeveloper: Microsoft\nUnique Features:\n\nPart of the DirectX family, providing a low-level API for ML.\nHardware-accelerated and works with any DirectX 12-compatible GPU.\n\nUse Cases: GPU-accelerated ML inference in Windows applications.\n\n\nThese platforms are more akin to runtime environments than traditional “virtual machines.” Still, they are optimized for GPU operations, and they play a role similar to VMs by providing a bridge between high-level code and low-level hardware instructions.\nMain Benefits of GPU-optimized Platforms: 1. Performance: Accelerate computations that can be parallelized, dramatically reducing the time required for tasks like training deep learning models. 2. Efficiency: Better utilization of available GPU resources, ensuring that the hardware’s full capabilities are harnessed. 3. Portability: In some cases (like CUDA to some extent), the platform provides an abstraction over the hardware, allowing code to run on different GPU architectures (within limits and considering vendor lock-ins). 4. Integration with Popular Tools: Many of these platforms offer integrations with popular ML frameworks, making it easier to transition from research to production.\nHowever, it’s essential to understand that while these platforms provide the tools and runtime for GPU-optimized operations, they don’t function as “virtual machines” in the traditional sense of emulating a complete computing environment. They are closer to specialized compilers and runtime environments."

Performance: Accelerate computations that can be parallelized, dramatically reducing the time required for tasks like training deep learning models. 2. Efficiency: Better utilization of available GPU resources, ensuring that the hardware’s full capabilities are harnessed. 3. Portability: In some cases (like CUDA to some extent), the platform provides an abstraction over the hardware, allowing code to run on different GPU architectures (within limits and considering vendor lock-ins). 4. Integration with Popular Tools: Many of these platforms offer integrations with popular ML frameworks, making it easier to transition from research to production.\nHowever, it’s essential to understand that while these platforms provide the tools and runtime for GPU-optimized operations, they don’t function as “virtual machines” in the traditional sense of emulating a complete computing environment. They are closer to specialized compilers and runtime environments."

RISC-V, on the other hand, is a specific, open-standard instruction set architecture (ISA) based on the RISC principles.\nWhile RISC and RISC-V are primarily associated with CPUs, the concepts and ISAs can be applied elsewhere. In fact, with the advent of more versatile computing platforms and the demand for specialized hardware accelerators, the lines between CPUs, GPUs, and other processing units can sometimes blur.\nGPUs and RISC\nGPUs (Graphics Processing Units) have a different historical design lineage than CPUs. While CPUs are designed for general-purpose tasks and can handle a wide variety of operations in sequence, GPUs are designed for parallelism, optimized for executing the same operation on a large number of data elements simultaneously. This design is especially suitable for graphics rendering tasks, where, for instance, the same shading operation might be applied to millions of pixels.\nThat said, modern GPUs have evolved and can handle more general-purpose tasks. This field, known as GPGPU (General-Purpose computing on Graphics Processing Units), has grown in prominence, especially with applications in scientific computing, machine learning, etc.\nThe instruction set architectures for GPUs are typically proprietary to the manufacturer: - NVIDIA GPUs use an architecture known as CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture). - AMD GPUs use architectures like GCN (Graphics Core Next) or RDNA.\nWhile these architectures might share some high-level concepts with RISC — like the importance of efficiency and streamlined operations — they’re not RISC architectures in the traditional sense.\nRISC-V and GPUs\nRISC-V, given its open nature, is seeing exploration beyond traditional CPUs. There are projects and discussions around using RISC-V principles in GPU design or other specialized hardware accelerators. However, as of my last training data in September 2021, RISC-V’s primary traction is in the CPU space, from microcontrollers to more powerful processors.\nIn conclusion, while RISC and RISC-V are primarily associated with CPUs, the principles and architectures are versatile. The GPU world has its architectures optimized for its specific tasks, but the lines between these domains are evolving, and there’s potential for overlap in the future.\n\nDesigning a VM for GPUs\nDesigning a virtual machine (VM) specifically optimized for GPUs and AI operations is not just a sensible idea, but it’s also a direction in which some sectors of the tech industry are heading. Let’s explore why this is a compelling notion and what features or characteristics such a VM might possess.\n\n\nRationale:\n\nSpecialized Operations: AI operations, especially deep learning, involve a lot of matrix multiplications and tensor operations. Traditional VMs are not optimized for these.\nMassive Parallelism: GPUs are inherently parallel and can handle thousands of threads simultaneously. A VM designed with this in mind would cater to this strength.\nMemory Management: Deep learning models, especially larger ones, can consume significant amounts of memory. Effective and efficient memory management tailored for these operations can greatly boost performance.\nInteroperability: AI frameworks and libraries are vast and varied (TensorFlow, PyTorch, ONNX, etc.). A VM optimized for AI could provide native support or efficient bridges for these frameworks.\n\n\n\nFeatures/Characteristics:\n\nTensor Operations: First-class support for tensor operations would be a fundamental feature.

Gauge groups are important in both classical and quantum field theories, as well as in the study of differential geometry and topology.\nIn the context of physics, gauge groups are used to describe the symmetries of a physical system. For example, in electromagnetism, the gauge group is the group of local phase transformations that leave the electromagnetic potential and field strength unchanged. Similarly, in the theory of the strong force, the gauge group is the group of local color transformations that leave the quark-gluon field strength unchanged.\nIn mathematics, gauge groups arise in the study of connections on vector bundles over a manifold. The gauge group is the group of transformations of the connection that leave the curvature of the connection invariant. These groups play an important role in the study of the topology and geometry of manifolds, and have applications in areas such as mathematical physics, algebraic geometry, and topology.\nOne of the key features of gauge groups is that the physical or mathematical properties of a system are invariant under gauge transformations. This means that different gauge choices can be made for the same physical or mathematical system, without affecting its essential properties. This property is known as gauge invariance and is a fundamental concept in many areas of physics and mathematics.\n\n\n\nThe Yang-Mills theory is a quantum field theory that describes the behavior of particles known as gauge bosons, which mediate the strong nuclear force. The theory is based on the idea of local gauge symmetry, which means that the fundamental equations of the theory are invariant under certain transformations of the fields that describe the particles.\nThe Yang-Mills equations describe the behavior of the gauge bosons, which are particles that transmit the strong force between quarks. The equations involve a set of mathematical terms that describe the interactions between the gauge bosons and the quarks.\nThe Yang-Mills equations are based on a set of mathematical objects known as gauge fields, which describe the behavior of the gauge bosons. The gauge fields are represented by a set of matrices, which are used to calculate the interactions between the gauge bosons and the quarks.\nThe equations are formulated using the mathematical concept of a gauge group, which describes the possible transformations that can be made to the gauge fields. In the case of the strong force, the gauge group is called SU(3), which stands for special unitary group of degree 3.\nThe Yang-Mills equations involve two terms: the kinetic term and the interaction term. The kinetic term describes the free motion of the gauge bosons, while the interaction term describes the interactions between the gauge bosons and the quarks.\nThe kinetic term involves the gauge field strength tensor, which is a mathematical object that describes the strength of the gauge field at each point in spacetime. The interaction term involves the coupling constant, which is a parameter that describes the strength of the interaction between the gauge bosons and the quarks.\nThe Yang-Mills equations are highly non-linear and require advanced mathematical techniques to solve. They are also closely related to the concept of gauge invariance, which means that the equations are invariant under certain transformations of the gauge fields.\nOverall, the Yang-Mills theory provides a mathematical framework for describing the behavior of the strong nuclear force, which is one of the four fundamental forces of nature. The theory has been extensively tested and is an important component of the Standard Model of particle physics, which describes the behavior of all known elementary particles and their interactions."

    "text": "My Encounters - as a Physicist - with Mathematics\n\n\n\nDonaldson theory is a branch of mathematics that is concerned with the topology of four-dimensional manifolds. It is named after Simon Donaldson, a British mathematician who made significant contributions to the field in the 1980s.\nThe central problem in Donaldson theory is to understand the topology of four-dimensional manifolds using differential geometry and algebraic topology. Specifically, the theory focuses on the study of vector bundles and connections on these manifolds, and how they can be used to classify different types of four-dimensional manifolds.\nOne of the key results in Donaldson theory is Donaldson’s theorem, which states that the intersection form of a smooth, closed, simply-connected four-dimensional manifold can be recovered from its Seiberg-Witten invariants. The Seiberg-Witten invariants are a set of numbers that can be associated with a four-dimensional manifold and its spin-c structure. They were introduced by Edward Witten and Nathan Seiberg in the mid-1990s and have proven to be a powerful tool in the study of four-dimensional manifolds.\nDonaldson theory has applications in a variety of fields, including physics, where it has been used to study the topology of spacetime in string theory and other areas of theoretical physics. It has also had significant impact in pure mathematics, inspiring further research in the fields of algebraic geometry, topology, and differential geometry.\n\n\n\n\nLie Algebras in Particle Physics\n\nLie Algebras in particle physics are mathematical structures that help to describe and classify physical systems, particularly those involving symmetries and transformations. In essence, a Lie algebra is a vector space equipped with a certain kind of product, called the Lie bracket, that captures the essential information about continuous transformations and symmetries. When applied to particle physics, Lie algebras offer a robust framework for understanding the fundamental particles and forces that govern the universe.\nThe concept of Lie algebras originated in the late 19th century with the work of Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie. Originally developed to study continuous transformation groups, the scope of Lie algebras has expanded to diverse areas of mathematics and physics. Their application in particle physics became increasingly significant during the 20th century, especially after the development of quantum mechanics and quantum field theory. The SU(3) Lie algebra, for example, was crucial in predicting the existence of particles like the omega-minus baryon before it was experimentally discovered.\nLie algebras offer a theoretical structure that is essential for formulating the Standard Model of particle physics, which describes electromagnetic, weak, and strong forces. Because Lie algebras are tightly connected to symmetry principles, they enable physicists to simplify complex systems and make predictions about particle interactions.\nApplications\n\nParticle Classification: Used for the classification of elementary particles into families and generations, assisting in the prediction of undiscovered particles.\nSymmetry Breaking: Helps in understanding the mechanism by which symmetry breaking occurs, a phenomenon critical to our understanding of the universe.\nField Theories: Employed in various quantum field theories to solve or approximate solutions for complex equations of motion.\nUnification Theories: Lie algebras and their corresponding Lie groups have been essential in attempts to develop Grand Unified Theories (GUTs) and even theories of everything.\n\nRelevant Subtopics\n\nBasic Definitions and Principles: Introduction to Lie groups, Lie algebras, and the relationship between them.\nRepresentation Theory: How Lie algebras can be represented as matrices, and why these representations are useful in particle physics.\nSU(N) Algebras: Special Unitary Groups of degree (N) and their importance in particle physics.\nSymmetry and Conservation Laws: Discussion on how Lie algebras relate to symmetries in physical systems and the corresponding conservation laws.\nApplication to the Standard Model: Utilizing Lie algebras to describe the particles and interactions within the Standard Model.\nAdvanced Topics: Covering roots, weights, Dynkin diagrams, and their role in particle physics."

The equation is given by:\n\\[R_{\\mu\\nu} - \\frac{1}{2}R g_{\\mu\\nu} + \\Lambda g_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{8\\pi G}{c^4} T_{\\mu\\nu}\\]\nwhere \\(R_{\\mu\\nu}\\) is the Ricci curvature tensor, \\(R\\) is the scalar curvature, \\(g_{\\mu\\nu}\\) is the metric tensor, \\(\\Lambda\\) is the cosmological constant, \\(G\\) is the gravitational constant, \\(c\\) is the speed of light, and \\(T_{\\mu\\nu}\\) is the stress-energy tensor.\nThe Ricci curvature tensor \\(R_{\\mu\\nu}\\) is a measure of the curvature of spacetime, and is related to the distribution of matter and energy through the stress-energy tensor \\(T_{\\mu\\nu}\\). The scalar curvature \\(R\\) is a measure of the overall curvature of spacetime, and is related to the Ricci curvature tensor through the Einstein field equation.\nThe metric tensor \\(g_{\\mu\\nu}\\) is a mathematical object that describes the geometry of spacetime. It specifies the distances between nearby points in spacetime and is used to calculate the curvature of spacetime. The cosmological constant \\(\\Lambda\\) is a parameter that was introduced by Einstein to allow for a static universe, but it is now thought to describe the energy density of the vacuum.\nThe stress-energy tensor \\(T_{\\mu\\nu}\\) describes the distribution of matter and energy in spacetime. It includes contributions from matter, radiation, and other forms of energy. The equation states that the curvature of spacetime is related to the distribution of matter and energy through the stress-energy tensor.\nIn summary, the Einstein field equation is a fundamental equation in general relativity that relates the geometry of spacetime to the distribution of matter and energy. It is a mathematical expression of the idea that matter and energy warp spacetime, and that the curvature of spacetime determines the motion of matter and energy.\n\n\nMinkowski Metric\nIn physics, the Minkowski metric (also known as the Minkowski spacetime or the Minkowski metric tensor) is a mathematical tool used to describe spacetime in special relativity. It is named after the German mathematician Hermann Minkowski, who developed the concept of spacetime as a four-dimensional manifold with a metric in the early 20th century.\nThe Minkowski metric describes the geometry of spacetime in special relativity. It is a mathematical object that assigns a distance or interval between two events in spacetime. In the Minkowski metric, the interval between two events is defined by:\n\\[ds^2 = -c^2 dt^2 + dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2\\]\nwhere \\(ds\\) is the spacetime interval between two events, \\(c\\) is the speed of light, \\(dt\\) is the time interval between the two events, and \\(dx\\), \\(dy\\), and \\(dz\\) are the three spatial intervals between the two events. The minus sign in front of the \\(c^2 dt^2\\) term ensures that the interval is negative for timelike separations, which represent events that can be causally connected, and positive for spacelike separations, which represent events that cannot be causally connected. The Minkowski metric has a signature of (-, +, +, +), which means that the time interval has the opposite sign compared to the spatial intervals.\nThe Minkowski metric is a special case of the more general metric tensor used in general relativity. In general relativity, the metric tensor is a function of the curvature of spacetime caused by matter and energy, and it is used to describe the gravitational field. However, in special relativity, where there is no gravitational field, the metric tensor is simply the Minkowski metric, and it describes the flat spacetime of special relativity."

Thus then spacetime gets extremly curved. But if we assume that spacetime remains flat, then we have to rewrite this as what is the local light propagation velocity tensor. Under that assumption this velocity will become equal to the EH surface for a location at the EH. Because still remains valid that nothing can exceed the local speed of light, this means that all matter will come at rest at the EH with every particle wave function frozen on that surface. Nothing ever traverses the EH. All accumulates on it. The BH grows by accumulating frozen matter at its EH surface.\nExactly. In other words, if you take the reference frame of light, you’ll see that the EH is pushed to oo, and all matter will be contained between the photon horizon (r=3M) and the EH (r=2M). (Is our universe rotating?)\nYou can’t take the reference frame of light. In every reference frame the light speed is the same, so “in the reference frame of light” makes no sense because there time is stopped. The EH can’t be seen on oo because for an observer between PS and EH there are a finite number of oscillations of his time reference from PS to EH. The assumption that the universe could rotate leads to a complication of all physical laws. We would get that there then has to be a rotation axis of the universe and that all rules are different with relation to that axis so that speed along the rotation direction can exceed c with any multiple without problems of inertia. This is similar to the Hubble expansion with the difference of an absolute rotation axis. That is why I reject both assumptions. It makes no sense to assume that space rotates. We rotate inside space. It also makes no sense to assume that space expands. We shrink inside space. The big one, space, is invariant, flat, not rotating, not translating, not curving. The small, what is inside space, rotates, translates, changes size. The only property of space that has a variation is that the propagation speed of light depends on the mass/energy density distribution in space.\nIsn’t it easier for Hawking radiation to escape if black holes have hair? So it’s not perfectly curved there. How does this equation differ from the superfluid quantum gravity spinning vortice(s) model of black holes?\n@bgreene marveled about the beauty of the equation. He didn’t gave a judgement about its validity. I gave an explanation on what assumptions are needed to allow this metric equation to be applicable. You come with the concept of a radiating BH. That only asks wether a particle pair of matter and antimatter could split such that one falks into, and one escapes the BH. But since the propagation speed of light at the EH is equal to the EH nothing moves there. So a hairy EH would assume that this propagation speed distribution is not smooth. This then should lead to particle wave functions to start from “stand still” and move outward. Such phenomen would need a different metric equation, but would not alter the beauty of the equation that @bgreene mentioned."

His MLPs had a non-learning first layer with randomized weights and an adaptive output layer. Although this was not yet deep learning, because only the last layer learned.\n\n\n\nSuccessful learning in deep feedforward network architectures started in 1965 in the Ukraine (back then the USSR) when Alexey Ivakhnenko & Valentin Lapa introduced the first general, working learning algorithms for deep MLPs with arbitrarily many hidden layers (already containing the now popular multiplicative gates).

The predictor (called the world model) sees the outputs of the controller and predicts environmental reactions to them. Using gradient descent, the predictor NN minimizes its error, while the generator NN tries to make outputs that maximize this error: one net’s loss is the other net’s gain\n\n\n\nJiirgen Schmidhuber published a paper describing an alternative to RNNs: A feedforward NN slowly learns by gradient descent to program the changes of the fast weights of another NN. Such Fast Weight Programmers (FWPs) can learn to memorize past data, too. In 1991, one of them computed its fast weight changes through additive outer products of self-invented activation patterns (now often called keys and values for self-attention). The very similar Transformers combine this with projections and softmax and are now widely used in natural language processing. For long input sequences, their efficiency was improved through Transformers with linearized self-attention whose core is formally equivalent to the 1991 Fast Weight Programmers.\n\n\n\nSepp Hochreiter and Jurgen Schmidhuber published Long Short-Term Memory, the most cited NN paper of the 20th century.

Intended to be the reinforcement learning version of ImageNet.\n\n\n2017: Attention is All You Need\nThe Google Brain team publishes a paper titled Attention is All You Need, introducing the Transformer - which is now an essential ingredient in many cutting edge models, particularly LLMs.\nThe key innovation is the idea of self-attention, a mechanism that allows the model to selectively choose which parts of the input to pay attention to rather than using the entire input equally.\nTransformers address RNN limitations by replacing recurrance with self attention. This weighs the importance of different parts of the input without having to maintain internal state. Much easier to parallize, and eliminates vanishing & exploding gradient problem.\nAlso 2017, Tesla poaches deep learning expert Andrej Karpathy from OpenAI to be its new head of Autopilot Vision.\n\n\n2018\n\nOpenAI Charter is published, which is later cited upon holding back powerful models like GPT-2.\nElon leaves OpenAI In early 2018, Musk told Sam Altman, another OpenAI founder, that he believed the venture had fallen fatally behind Google, people familiar with the matter said. Musk proposed a possible solution: He would take control of OpenAI and run it himself.\n\nAltman and OpenAI’s other founders rejected Musk’s proposal. Musk, in turn, walked away from the company — and reneged on a massive planned donation. The fallout from that conflict, culminating in the announcement of Musk’s departure on Feb 20, 2018, would shape the industry that’s changing the world, and the company at the heart of it.\nFebruary 20, 2018 announcement that Elon is departing. In the same month, OpenAI switched cloud providers from Amazon to Google, signing an agreement to spend at least $63 million with the tech giant over the next two years.\n\n\n2019\n\nOpenAI shifts from nonprofit to ‘capped-profit’ to attract capital.\n\nJuly 2019, Microsoft invests $1 billion in OpenAI to develop AI technologies on Microsoft Azure.\n\n\n2020\nOctober 2020, GPT-3 is released.\n\n\nCont’d\nOpenAI debtus DALL-E, text-to-image.\nDecember 2022, ChatGPT\n\n\n2023\nJanuary 2023, Microsoft buys 49% of OpenAI at $29 billion valuation.\nMarch 14, 2023: GPT-4.\nMay 2023, Governance of superintelligence blog published\nJuly 24, 2023: Attention is off by One"

Solid solution series occur when two or more different elements can substitute for each other in a mineral’s structure to a significant degree. Here, the variable x represents a range of compositions that can exist within this series.\nThe formula indicates that for every 6 units of phosphate (PO4) and one oxygen (O), there are 10-x lead (Pb) atoms and x copper (Cu) atoms. The “x” in the formula implies that the copper content can vary, essentially representing a range of similar minerals with varying amounts of copper and lead. As the copper content increases (x increases), the lead content decreases correspondingly.\nPlease note that this is a general explanation and the specifics of the mineral can vary greatly depending on its formation conditions and geological setting.\nIf you want to understand this equation thoroughly, you would need to delve into crystal chemistry and solid state physics.\nCrystal Chemistry: The substitution of Pb by Cu is possible due to similarities in their ionic radii and charge. Minerals form in specific crystalline structures and the substitution of one atom for another depends on these factors.\nSolid State Physics: The physical properties of this mineral series, such as its electrical conductivity or magnetic properties, would vary based on the exact ratio of Pb to Cu. Understanding these properties requires knowledge of solid state physics."

It’s not that the steel produced before these explosions is stronger or of better quality, but it’s that the steel manufactured after the start of the atomic age is slightly radioactive.\nIn 1945, when the first atomic bombs were detonated during World War II, they released various radionuclides, including Carbon-14 and other radioactive isotopes, into the atmosphere. These isotopes circled the globe and were incorporated into many things, including the iron ore used to produce steel. As a result, steel produced after 1945 can exhibit slight radioactivity.\nThis can be an issue in certain sensitive applications where even the tiniest amount of background radiation can interfere with equipment operation or measurements, like Geiger counters, certain medical equipment, and scientific devices used in physics and geology. For these uses, pre-war or low-background steel, typically salvaged from pre-1945 ships and buildings, is often sought.\n\n\nResearch\n\nLow-Background Steel Wiki\nReadiation Damage Wiki\nRadiation Effects in Steel\nInvestigation of Natural Radioactivity and Dose Assessment over Steel Making Region\nEffects of Irradiation on Mechanical Properties\nIs neutron radiation exposure always detrimental to metals (steels)?\nEffects of Radiation Damage"

This became the foundation for the Transformer. - Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate - ffective Approaches to Attention-based Neural Machine Translation\nThe attention mechanism allows the model to assign different weights or importance to different parts of the input sequence when making predictions or generating output. Instead of relying solely on fixed-length vector representations or encoding the entire input sequence into a fixed-length representation, the attention mechanism enables the model to dynamically attend to relevant parts of the input at each step of the computation.\nIn a typical attention mechanism, there are three main components:\n\nQuery: A query represents the current step or position in the output generation process. It is used to compare against different parts of the input sequence to determine their relevance.\nKey: The keys are representations of the different parts of the input sequence. These keys are compared to the query to measure their similarity or relevance.\nValue: The values are additional information associated with the input sequence parts. They provide the context or content that the model focuses on.\n\nThe attention mechanism computes a similarity score between the query and each key, which determines the relevance or attention assigned to the corresponding value. These similarity scores are typically computed using dot products, additive or multiplicative operations, or neural networks.\nThe resulting attention weights are used to weight the values associated with the input sequence parts. This weighted information is then combined or aggregated to provide a context-aware representation for the current step, allowing the model to focus more on relevant parts of the input.\nBy incorporating attention mechanisms into deep learning models, they can effectively capture dependencies between different elements of the input sequence, improve performance on sequential tasks, and handle long-range dependencies more effectively than traditional fixed-length representations.\n\n\nThe Transformer “Attention is All You Need”\nPaper published by a team at Google Brain. - Attention is All You Need\nThe Transformer architecture is built on the idea of self-attention or scaled dot-product attention, which can be seen as an extension of the attention mechanism. In traditional sequence-to-sequence models, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), sequential information is processed step by step, which can be computationally expensive and hinder parallelization.\nThe key innovation of the Transformer is that it replaces recurrent layers with self-attention layers. Self-attention allows the model to compute the relationships between all positions in the input sequence simultaneously. This means that each position can attend to any other position, capturing global dependencies in the sequence. By doing so, the Transformer can process inputs in parallel and handle long-range dependencies more effectively.\nThe Transformer architecture consists of two main components: the encoder and the decoder. The encoder takes an input sequence and generates a sequence of contextualized representations, while the decoder takes the encoder’s output and generates the final output sequence.\nWithin the encoder and decoder, the Transformer uses multi-head self-attention mechanisms. Instead of a single self-attention mechanism, multiple attention heads are employed to capture different types of information and attend to different parts of the input sequence simultaneously. This allows the model to focus on different aspects of the input and learn more diverse and expressive representations.\nThe Transformer also introduces positional encoding, which provides information about the position of each element in the input sequence. Since self-attention lacks the notion of position, positional encoding enables the model to incorporate sequential information into its computations.\nThe dominance of the Transformer architecture in modern AI can be attributed to several factors:\n\nParallelization: The self-attention mechanism in the Transformer enables parallel processing of inputs, making it highly efficient for training on modern hardware, such as graphics processing units (GPUs) or tensor processing units (TPUs).\nLong-range dependencies: The self-attention mechanism allows the Transformer to capture dependencies between distant positions in the input sequence, making it more effective in modeling long-range relationships compared to traditional recurrent architectures.\nExpressiveness: By employing multiple attention heads and capturing different types of information, the Transformer can learn more expressive and rich representations of the input data.\nTransferability: The Transformer has shown strong performance across a wide range of NLP tasks, such as machine translation, language understanding, text generation, and more. Its effectiveness and versatility have made it a popular choice and a basis for many state-of-the-art models.\n\nOverall, the Transformer’s ability to model global dependencies, parallelize computations, and learn expressive representations has contributed to its dominance in modern AI, particularly in the field of natural language processing.\n\n\nBackpropogation\nBackpropogation is an algorithm for training neural-networks, used to update its weights to minimize the ‘loss’\n\nNetwork makes a prediction on a batch of input data\nLoss is calculated between predicted and actual output\nGradient of the loss with respect to the weights are calculated using the chain rule of differentiation\nThe gradients are used to update the weights in the opposite direction of the gradient, reducing the loss\nRepeat the process until the loss reaches a satisfactory level or a maximum number of iterations"
