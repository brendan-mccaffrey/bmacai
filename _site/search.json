    "text": "How it worked\nAttacker had two accounts, let’s call them account A and account B.\n\nAttacker funds account A with $5 million of USDC, to be used as collateral for on-chain positions.\nAttacker then offered out (sold short) ~483 million MNGO tokens, trading at $0.038 at the time.\nAttacker then funds account B with $5 million USDC, and purchases those ~438 million MNGO at $0.0382\nAttacker then purchases MNGO on the Spot market, artificially increasing its price. The price of mango reached $0.91 (a 24x increase).\nAt this new inflated price, account B was in the money for ~ $423 million. He used this account value to take out a loan of $116 million consisting of several tokens.\nAfter the attack, the MNGO/USD spot market then traded down to $0.02, which put account A in the money. However, Mango protocol was effectively drained of all liquidity, so account A could not be paid out."

    "text": "Summary\nMango Markets were designed to give loans at a certain collateralization ratio (e.g. 400%), but they used the spot market as an oracle for “fair price” of the token. Thus, tokens with low liquidity could be easily manipulated such that the protocol believes “fair price” is multiples above what anyone would purchase the token at in free markets."

    "section": "Future Mitigation",
    "text": "Future Mitigation\nMitigating this type of attack is as simple as fixing the Oracle mechanism. For example, one could use a 24hr rolling average price to determine “fair value” for lending, which would make the market manipulator’s attack much more difficult (must pump price for 24 hour rather than a few seconds)."

However, it is an important final safeguard on the solvency of the platform. There is a strict invariant that under all operation, a user who has no open positions will not socialize any losses of the platform.” - Yea, unless the insurance fund gets rinsed lol.\nMarket Making\n\nIf you’re interested in market making, reach out via Telegram @HyperliquidX We should show interest\n\nVaults\nAnyone can make their account a “vault” which is essentially a copy-trade program.
