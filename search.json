    "title": "On the Risks of AI",
    "section": "",
    "text": "There exist distinct risks related to AI. Each posing a different severity and relevant on a different timeline.\n\nBackground\nI’ve spent a some time meditating on this question. I have interacted with the industry as a consumer, as an investor, as a startup contributor, and as a (novice) developer. Most importantly, I’ve had fruitful discussions with, and have listened very carefully to, many people with more perspectives than I.\nThat’s not to say my views are necessarily important, or even correct - it’s just a bit of context. I remain open-minded, and I welcome discussion, counter-points, and new information…\nI see two main, distinct vectors of risk\n\nLoss of Human Dominance\nCentralization of Information Flow\n\n\n\nLoss of Human Dominance\nThe first and most focused on vector of risk is the danger of a(n) agent(s) which surpass(es) humans in intelligence & aptitude. This is the rogue AGI scenario. Humans have held the top spot for ~300,000 years, and no one is capable of predicting what would happen if/when that changes.\nThis is the vector addressed by “Pause Giant AI Experiments: An Open Letter”\nI believe this vector of risk is real, and it is tremendously dangerous.\n\nCybersecurity will become very tricky.\nMilitary applications will introduce existential threats\nDomestic use cases (surveillance, policing) will yield tremendous controversy\n\nIn my opinion, the day-to-day news stories/headlines draw too much attention and cause us to overestimate the short-term risks. Yet, the longer term horizon of this paradigm remain wildly under-appreciated. Regardless of the severity of this risk vector, a “pause” on AI will never happen.\nThis is an arms race.\n\n\nCentralization of Information Flow\nThe second vector of risk, which I believe is more relevant in the short-term, regards what’s being referred to as the “Moderation Layer”.\nThis risk is not about the AI agent itself. Rather, it concerns the humans & organizations that own these models and are responsible for regulating (or in the position to regulate) usage. Although discussion on the correct approach to regulation/moderation takes place, these often happen in the political realm, wherein a strictly two-dimensional tug-of-war stagnates.\nMain Question:\nWhat is the goal of the moderation layer, and why is it necessary?\n\n“To censor dangerous content”\n\nWhat exactly defines “dangerous”? Would a blanket definition of “dangerous” be acceptable? For example, allowing an AI explain how to enrich Uranium to a jihadist group can likely be considered dangerous. Allowing the AI to explain this to a group of PhD Chemical Engineers, on the other hand, is not as dangerous.\n\n“To censor offensive content”\n\nAll statements are offensive to some extent, so where exactly are we drawing the line? To what extent should we be tolerant in the name of free speech? “Offensive” is a spectrum - there is no statement that offends none. It becomes clear to ask, to what extent are we willing to restrict the freedom of thought to protect users from being offended?\n\n“To limit the spread of misinformation”\n\nI have an appreciation for the harm that AI can do with respect to proliferating false information. But if the past few years have taught us anything, it’s that “misinformation” is now synonymous with “I don’t like that information”.\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) like OpenAI’s GPT-4 are trained on billions of lines of text, extracted from the internet, from millions of (human) sources of various demographics, representing a vast array of perspectives.\nOpenAI’s moderation layer is built by less than 100 humans, nearly all of whom have a similar background and reside in Silicon Valley.\n\n“The political ideology of conversational AI”\n\n\nTo believe the latter is capable of mitigating the bias the former, in my humble opinion, is misled.\n\nSee GPT-4 System Card, the Appendix\n\nI am not claiming the former (the agent) is unbiased. LLMs are trained heavily on text from Reddit, for example, which has an overrepresentation of men than women. Further, as (almost) all training data is extracted from the internet, the information from which the AI model “learns” is inherently biased towards the digital world: internet users, citizens of first world countries, etc.\nMy current stance is that the moderation layer is necessary, but\n\nThe implementation details of the moderation layer must be transparent.\nGovernance of the moderation layer must be, to some extent, decentralized. At the very least, let us agree the power should not lie solely in the hands of 0.00000125% of the world’s population."

    "text": "mRNA Vaccine\n\nThe mRNA platform is brilliant. But it has a giant gaping flaw in it, which is; Any cell of yours that produces a foreign protein, will be targetted by your immune system and destroyed. You will create an autoimmune disorder. When it works. How do you keep it out of your heart. Not by coding it in a lipid nanoparticle. So, they had no way to deliver it safely to market. So then they had a pandemic, the emergency allowed them to do it. This technology, in my opinion, was at least 3 decades out from being usefully and safely deployed at all, if at all. They did not want to wait, this crisis gave them the opportunity not to wait. And now, they will blame the spike protein, we picked the wrong protein. When in actual fact there are 2 problems, the spike protein and the platform itself. - Brett Weinstein\n\n\nMyocarditis/Pericarditis\n\nDifferent virus vs vax myocarditis mechanisms isn’t just theory. Here’s why you’re correct in real life.\n\n\nTIMING\n\nVirus myocarditis As Offit said, SARS2 viral myocarditis most often manifests as post-viral myocarditis due to molecular mimicry.\n\nThis means a few to several weeks after covid infection (ie symptoms/viral load were already gone weeks or 1-2 months ago), there is Ab/T crossreactivity (mimicry) to self-antigens in heart cells.\nThis mechanism is most often mild, good prognosis.\nTo clarify, SARS2 viral fulminant myocarditis, which can occur in days to a week after covid infection, is very rare. Initial covid presentation with fulminant myocarditis is so rare and unusual, it’s a case report. Almost all SARS2 viral myocarditis is post-viral and mild.\n\nVax myocarditis Most often occurs days to 1 week after 2nd vax dose. Also occurs after 1st vax dose or booster.\n\nThis timing is atypical of mimicry. Rather, this timing is textbook for a primary or secondary direct immune cell attack on mRNA-transfected heart cells.\nOffit knows all this. He’s obviously pulling a “limited hangout”. Pfizer will copy what Offit says.\nIf politicians were honest, they’d ask if mechanisms are the same (mimicry) for both virus and vax myo, then why are the timing and severity distinctly different for virus vs vax myo?\n\n\nSerum Vax Spike\n\nCirculating Spike Protein Detected in Post–COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine Myocarditis\n\nThere’s a high correlation of vax spike found in serum (blood) of vax myocarditis. Vax controls showed no serum vax spike.\nImportantly, Ab/T immunoprofiling of vax myocarditis patients were indistinguishable from vax controls (ie no unusual autoantibodies or autoreactive T cells (no mimicry signs)).\nThis is more evidence that in vax myo, your immune cells are killing your own heart cells that look virus-infected.\nThere’s more vax myo mechanisms like inflammasome or apoptosis. But you said the main vax myo mechanism perfectly.”"

    "text": "The Saudi Connection, Summary\n\nPeople\nOmar al-Bayoumi\nThe FBI has received numerous reports… dating back to 1999, alleging that al-Bayoumi may be a Saudi intelligence officer. FBI files suggest that al-Bayoumi provided substantial assistance to hijackers Khalid al-Mihdhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi after they arrived in San Diego in 2000. During this same timeframe, al-Bayoumi had extensive contact with Saudie Government establishments in the United States and received financial support from a Saudi company affiliated with the Saudi Ministry of defense. That company reportedly had ties to Osama Bin Ladin and al-Qa’ida.\nAl-Bayoumi was receiving substantial sums of money from the Saudi Embassy in Washington, DC prior to the 9/11 attacks… this money was being funneled from accounts at Riggs Bank belonging to Haifa bin Faisal, the wife of the Saudi Ambassador to the United States, Bandar bin Sultan.\nFahad Al-Thumairy\nA Saudi government official who was assigned to the Saudi Consulate in Los Angeles prior to 9/11. “… worked for the Saudi government in the Department of Religious Affairs”. Al-Thumairy was later deported from the U.S. on suspicion of links to terrorism.\nOsama Bassnan\nBassnan may have been in contact with al-Mihdhar and al-Hazmi during their time in San Diego. He was a close associate of al-Bayoumi and Omar Bakarbashat, another one of the hijackers’ close associates. He told another individual that he met al-Hazmi through al-Bayoumi and later that he met two of the hijackers through al-Bayoumi. Bassnan has many ties to the Saudi government, including past employment by the Saudi Arabian Education Mission. FBI received reports from individuals in the Muslim community alleging that Bassnan might be a Saudi intelligence officer. According to a CIA memo Bassnan reportedly received funding and possibly a fake passport from Saudi Government officials. He and his wife received financial support from the Saudi Ambassador to the United States and his wife. He met with a member of the Saudi Royal Family in Houston in 2002 and received a significant amount of cash. FBI information indicates that Bassnan is an extremist and supporter of Osama Bin Ladin.\nAbdullah Bin Ladin\nAbdullah Bin Ladin claims to work for the Saudi Embassy in Washington, D.C. as an administrative officer. He is identified by the FBI as Osama Bin Ladin’s half brother.\nKhalid al-Mihdhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi\nHijackers on the pentagon flight.\nMusaed A. Al-Jarrah\nAbdullah Al Ajroush\n“…not aware of any contact Al Ajroush has had with the FBI”\n“PENTTBOM Investigation”\n\n\nFacts\nSeveral of the phone numbers found in the phone book of Abu Zubaida, a senior al-Qa’ida operative captured in Pakistan in March 2002, could be linked, at least indirectly, to phone numbers in the United States. One of those numbers is subscribed to by the ASPCOL Corporation. A November 18, 2002 FBI respoonse to the Joint Inquiry states that “CIA traces have revealed no direct links between numbers found in Zubaida’s phone book and numbers in the United States.” The number of a bodyguard at the Saudi Embassy in Washington, DC, was also found in Zubaida’s possesion."

After 9/11, Silverstein took the insurance company to court, claiming he should be paid double because there were 2 attacks.

    "text": "Mycotoxins are secondary metabolites produced by fungi that contaminate various types of food and feed. They are toxic to humans and animals, leading to a range of health issues. Not all fungi produce mycotoxins; mainly Aspergillus, Fusarium, and Penicillium genera are culprits.\n\nTypes:\n\nAflatoxins: Produced mainly by Aspergillus, found in nuts, corn, and oilseeds. Carcinogenic.\nOchratoxins: Found in cereals, coffee, dried fruits. Nephrotoxic and possibly carcinogenic.\nFumonisins: Produced by Fusarium, common in maize. Associated with esophageal cancer.\nTrichothecenes: Produced by Fusarium, common in cereals. Immunosuppressive.\nZearalenone: Produced by Fusarium, estrogenic effects.\n\nMycotoxins primarily enter the body through food consumption. They can also be inhaled or enter through the skin, although these routes are less common.\n\n\nEntry Mechanisms:\n\nOral: Ingested through contaminated food; absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract. Aflatoxins and ochratoxins are often absorbed in the small intestine.\nInhalation: Spores from contaminated environments can carry mycotoxins into the respiratory system.\nDermal: Skin contact with contaminated materials.\n\n\n\nInteraction with the Body:\n\nAbsorption: Once in the gut, mycotoxins are rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream.\nDistribution: Transported via blood to various organs. Lipophilic mycotoxins like aflatoxins have high affinity for fatty tissues.\nMetabolism: Liver is the primary site. Cytochrome P450 enzymes may convert mycotoxins into more or less toxic metabolites.\nExcretion: Mainly through urine and feces. Some can also be excreted through sweat or breast milk.\n\n\n\nBlood-Brain Barrier:\nSome mycotoxins can cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Ochratoxins, for instance, have been found in the brain tissues of exposed animals, indicating potential neurotoxicity.\nUnderstanding these mechanisms can guide both preventive and therapeutic measures. Given your medical background, further study into the pharmacokinetics and toxicodynamics of these substances could be of interest.\n\n\nHealth Effects:\n\nCarcinogenicity\nImmunosuppression\nNeurotoxicity\nGastrointestinal issues\nHormonal imbalance\n\n\n\nDetection:\n\nHPLC: High-performance liquid chromatography\nELISA: Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay\nMass Spectrometry\n\n\n\nManagement:\n\nPrevention: Good agricultural and storage practices\nDetoxification: Chemical and biological methods, but efficacy varies.\nRegulations: Stringent limits in food/feed products set by regulatory bodies like the FDA and EU.\n\n\n\nClinical Implications:\n\nDiagnosis primarily through symptomatology and confirmed via bioassays.\nTreatment usually involves supportive care and toxin removal strategies like activated charcoal.\n\n\n\nFuture Research:\n\nMore efficient detox methods\nGenetically engineered crops resistant to mycotoxin-producing fungi\nPredictive modeling for contamination.\n\nUnderstanding mycotoxins is crucial for both public health measures and clinical interventions. Given your background, delving into molecular mechanisms and clinical trials could provide further insights."

    "text": "Vitamin D\nVitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin essential for calcium absorption and bone health. It exists in two main forms: D2 (ergocalciferol) and D3 (cholecalciferol). D2 is primarily sourced from plants and fortified foods, while D3 is synthesized in the skin upon sun exposure and also obtained from animal-based foods. D3 is generally more effective at raising blood levels of vitamin D. Both forms are converted in the liver and kidneys to their active form, calcitriol.\n\nBenefits\nVitamin D facilitates calcium absorption in the gut, essential for maintaining bone health. It also plays roles in immune function, cell growth, and inflammation regulation.\nD2 and D3 are similar in function but differ in potency and duration. D3 is generally more effective in raising and maintaining serum 25(OH)D levels.\nVitamin D benefits: 1. Bone Health: Enhances calcium and phosphate absorption, reducing osteoporosis risk. 2. Immune System: Modulates innate and adaptive immune responses, possibly reducing susceptibility to infections. 3. Cellular Growth: Involved in cell differentiation, potentially reducing the risk of certain cancers. 4. Mood Regulation: Impacts serotonin levels, possibly affecting mood disorders like depression.\nInadequate vitamin D can lead to poor bone health, increased susceptibility to infections, and a range of chronic conditions. Proper intake or synthesis helps maintain physiological equilibrium across multiple systems.\n\n\nSunlight v. Oral\nSunlight exposure can produce variable amounts of vitamin D3, influenced by factors like skin type, sunscreen use, and clothing. In strong sunlight (UV index ~9), 15–30 minutes for fair-skinned individuals can produce around 10,000 to 20,000 IU of vitamin D3.\n\n\n\nVitamin Doesn’t Work\nSupplementing Vitamin D3 does not overcome seasonal affective disorder (SAD).\n\nexplanation tweet"

    "text": "Cold as a Therapeutic Agent\nCold for Centuries\nHuman physiological responses to immersion into water of different temperatures\nAltered brown fat thermoregulation and enhanced cold-induced thermogenesis in young, healthy, winter-swimming men\nImpact of Cold-Water Immersion Compared with Passive Recovery Following a Single Bout of Strenuous Exercise on Athletic Performance in Physically Active Participants\nNovel Application of Chemical Cold Packs for Treatment of Exercise-Induced Hyperthermia\nShort-term cold exposure supports human Treg induction in vivo\nDifferences between men and women\n\n\n\nThe use of cold-water immersion has a long and rich history. The beneficial effects on human physiology have been recorded as far back as 3500BC @Wang Et Al., with the Edwin Smith Papyrus (the most ancient medical text known to date) making references to cold being used for therapeutic purposes. The Ancient Greeks utilized cold-water therapies, as recorded by Hippocrates in the fourth century BC. And even the Golden Age of Rome featured cold-water immersion as treatment for fever, advocated for by Roman Physician Claudius Galen in the second century AD @Allan Et Al.. It was only until recently, however, that modern science began to explore the underlying physiological processes behind the power of the cold.\n\n\n\nDeliberate cold exposure triggers a release of epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine (noradrenaline) into the bloodstream. These hormones are responsible for the fight-or-flight response, and can make us feel alert and/or agitated @Huberman. This is why many people feel more energized after a cold shower or a cold swim.\n\n\n\nCold exposure has been shown to increase energy expenditure, which can lead to weight loss and improved body composition. It has been recommended as a healthy and sustainable alternative strategy for increasing energy expenditure @van Marken Lichtenbelt Et Al..\nA core aspect of cold exposure is the activation of brown adipose tissue (BAT). BAT is a type of fat tissue that is responsible for thermogenesis, or the production of heat. It is found in small amounts in adults, but is more abundant in children. It is also found in higher concentrations in people who are leaner. The activation of BAT is thought to be responsible for the increased energy expenditure that is observed after cold exposure @Huberman.\n\n\n\nA study published in the Journal of Applied Physiology found that cold exposure “induced a leukocytosis and granulocytosis, an increase in natural killer cell count and activity, and a rise in circulating levels of interleukin-6.” @Brenner Et Al.. In other words, this means that cold exposure increases the number of white blood cells, which are responsible for fighting infection, and increases the activity of natural killer cells, which are responsible for destroying cancer cells. It also increases the production of interleukin-6, which is a cytokine that plays a role in the immune response.\nA fundamental aspect of cold exposure therapy is the subconcious respiratory response by the sympathetic nervous system. Upon cold immersion, you may find your breathing rate to increase, and your breaths to deepen. It was traditionally believed that the sympathetic nervous system and immune system could not be voluntarily influenced.\nIn 2011, however, the “Ice Man” Wim Hof participated in a study wherein he was injected with endotoxin, a treated form of E coli bacteria which triggers the same immune response. The study produced groundbreaking results, claiming that through the use of Hof’s breathing technique, he voluntarily and significantly increased his immune system response to the bacteria and completely avoided the flu-like symptoms displayed by healthy participants within the control group. In an attempt to discover if this result was reproducable or an anomoly of Wim Hof himself, a study published in the National Library of Medicine in 2014 replicated the methods with individuals who were trained on the breathing technique prior to the injection. It was again found that the breathing technique resulted in an immediate and profound decrease of pCO2 and bicarbonate, and an increase in pH, indicating acute respiratory alkalosis, which normalized quickly after cessation of the breathing techniques. In laymans terms, this means that humans could, through the use of breathing techniques, voluntarily increase immune system activity.\n\n\n\nCold exposure has been shown to increase the production of endorphins, such as dopmain, which are responsible for the “runner’s high” and other feelings of euphoria. It has also been shown to increase the production of serotonin, which is responsible for feelings of happiness and well-being. Increased dopamin release can last for as long as 6 hours after cold exposure, and increased serotonin release can last for as long as 24 hours after cold exposure @Ootsuka.\n\n\n\nCold water immersion has been reported to increase the level of T-cells (specifically, peripheral T lymphocytes). This has been observed both (1) in the short term after a single treatment/swim, as well as (2) in a longer, sustained manner after a period of multiple treatments per week.\nT-cells, also known as T lymphocytes, are a type of white blood cell that are derived from bone marrow stem cells and mature in the thymus gland. They play an essential role in fighting off infection. With an ability to “recognize” and “remember” germs that they have seen before, they can quickly respond if they see that germ again.\nIn other studies, similar increases have been observed for NK (Natural killer) cells. NK cell activity has been observed to increase both briefly after a treatment and in a sustained manner following consistent and repeated immersions.\nNatural killer (NK) cells are a type of white blood cell that can quickly recognize and destroy infected or cancerous cells without prior exposure or activation. NK cells do not require prior exposure to antigens, which are proteins or other molecules that can trigger an immune response. Instead, they use a variety of receptors to detect abnormal cells and then release toxic substances to kill them.\n\n\n\nAlthough the science is still developing, there is reason to believe cold water immersion may help prevent the risk of tumors and cancers.\nIn a study done on lab mice, a “somewhat reduced spontaneous incidence of tumors, especially sarcomas” was observed among the group of mice that endured repeated cold stress (cold swims). It has also been reported that Cold-inducible RNA binding protein (CIRP) may function as a tumor suppressor via suppressing proliferation. Finally, there’s been a clinical review performed by the National Institute of Health (NIH) exploring the cold’s ability to stimulate “anti-tumor immunity”, which concluded this area deserves “more research as a major target for cancer therapies.”\nWe look forward to the progression of this research.\n\n\n\nWestern biomedical research is gradually discovering the significance of the way in which we breathe, in relation to the body and its many physiological processes. Among these discoveries are how deliberate breathing techniques can 1. increase our tolerance to extremely cold environments and 2. alter immune function in real time.\nLet me highlight the significance of these discoveries: For centuries, modern (Western) medicine considered these processes (circulatory system, immune system, sympathetic nervous system) autonomic or involuntary, meaning they are unable to be controlled consciously. Recent research has slipped this understanding upside down - essentially, deliberate breathing practice is a superpower.\nThere is incredible research on breathing methods/techniques beyond the scope of this article, spanning brain function, enlightened & hallucinogenic states, mood/emotion control, and more. We encourage you to explore it if you’re interested, and we hope to come back to the topic in a future article/series.\nThe first groundbreaking study was done on Wim “The Ice Man” Hof, himself. In 2011, researchers at Radboud University injected Wim Hof with endotoxin, a treated form of bacteria that triggers a general immune response, as Wim practiced his breathing technique. The results were astounding:\n\n…levels of inflammatory mediators in Hof’s blood were much lower. On average, Hof’s immune response was decreased by 50 percent compared to other healthy volunteers. In addition, hardly any flu-like symptoms were observed.\n\nAt first, this study was a target of skepticism. With a sample size of 1, it was unclear whether the results were reproducible or simply Wim Hof producing an outlier result as an individual. However, it was enough to encourage further exploration.\nIn 2014, a study published in the National Library of Medicine sought out to reproduce the 2011 results in average “healthy participants”. The intervention group was trained for just 10 minutes in Hof’s breathing technique, and then both groups were administered with the endotoxin.\n\nIn the intervention group, practicing the learned techniques resulted in intermittent respiratory alkalosis and hypoxia resulting in profoundly increased plasma epinephrine levels. In the intervention group, plasma levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 increased more rapidly after endotoxin administration, correlated strongly with preceding epinephrine levels, and were higher. Levels of proinflammatory mediators TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-8 were lower in the intervention group and correlated negatively with IL-10 levels. Finally, flu-like symptoms were lower in the intervention group.\n\nIn summary, the results were successfully reproduced, and the researchers concluded that it is possible to voluntarily activate the sympathetic nervous system and affect immune response through deliberate breathing technique.\nHof’s breathing technique shook the biomedical science industry again in 2018, this time after he showed humans can consciously enhance their ability to survive in extremely cold conditions (beyond what was previously thought possible). The study concluded that deliberate breathing technique resulted in “increased sympathetic innervation and glucose consumption in intercostal muscle, generating heat that dissipates to lung tissue and warms circulating blood in the pulmonary capillaries.”\n\n\n\nThe optimal, and most studied, approach entails complete submersion in cold water from the neck down. To sit in water from the chest down, with arms outstretched, for instance, precludes full stimulation of the stress response mechanisms which yield many of the advantages discussed in the previous two sections of this series.\nLikewise, although cold showers have demonstrated efficacy, they have not been subjected to the same level of scrutiny as cold water immersion from the neck down. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that the most optimal results may be obtained through full immersion in cold water. In the event that access to a cold bath is unattainable, cold showers serve as a reasonable alternative.\n\n\n\nThe short answer to this question is: uncomfortable but safe. Discomfort means that the beneficial stress hormones discussed in part 1 are being released in your system, thus offering the corresponding benefits.\nIf you are getting started, you may find that water temperatures around 45 degrees Fahrenheit is enough to feel uncomfortable. Over time, you are likely to find your cold immersion routine becomes easier. If you want to progress, and continue to extract maximum benefit, you must be honest with yourself to recognize whether you are pushing yourself, and increase intensity (decrease temperature) as appropriate.\n\n\n\nA study done by Scandinavian scientist Dr. Susanna Søeberg suggests the magic number is at least 11 minutes per week, total. This is the threshold needed to increase brown fat thermogenesis and metabolism. This could be done in various ways, such as spreading it out throughout the week or doing it all in one day.\n\n\n\nScience suggests that whether cold exposure is done in the morning or at night does not affect the health benefits discussed previously. However, I personally recommend doing your cold exposure first thing in the morning.\nThe reason why relates to internal body temperature and circadian rhythm. Your body is warm when it is awake, and cold when it is asleep. In fact, studies have shown your body temperature must decrease by 1.5 degrees in order to fall asleep.\nExposure to cold temperatures can cause your body to heat up afterwards, making it more difficult to fall asleep if done late at night. On the other hand, if performed early in the morning, cold exposure may boost your energy levels and start your day off on the right foot.\n\n\n\nThe Søeberg Principle, developed by Dr. Susana Søeberg, posits the following:\nTo enhance the metabolic effects of cold, force your body to reheat on its own\n\nEnd With Cold\n\nAdditionally, the act of shivering during or after cold exposure can further activate brown fat thermogenesis and release heat from muscles, resulting in heightened metabolic increases.\nTo increase shivering and optimize the metabolic benefits of cold exposure, individuals are advised to avoid huddling and wrapping their arms around themselves while in the cold or after exiting it. Likewise, entering a sauna after cold exposure, although relaxing, will limit the metabolic benefits of the cold.\nIf you want to go further, it is recommended to refrain from towel drying and instead allowing the body to naturally reheat and dry off. Admittedly, this is difficult, especially when it’s cold outside."

Instead, they use a variety of receptors to detect abnormal cells and then release toxic substances to kill them.\n\n\n\nAlthough the science is still developing, there is reason to believe cold water immersion may help prevent the risk of tumors and cancers.\nIn a study done on lab mice, a “somewhat reduced spontaneous incidence of tumors, especially sarcomas” was observed among the group of mice that endured repeated cold stress (cold swims). It has also been reported that Cold-inducible RNA binding protein (CIRP) may function as a tumor suppressor via suppressing proliferation. Finally, there’s been a clinical review performed by the National Institute of Health (NIH) exploring the cold’s ability to stimulate “anti-tumor immunity”, which concluded this area deserves “more research as a major target for cancer therapies.”\nWe look forward to the progression of this research.\n\n\n\nWestern biomedical research is gradually discovering the significance of the way in which we breathe, in relation to the body and its many physiological processes. Among these discoveries are how deliberate breathing techniques can 1. increase our tolerance to extremely cold environments and 2. alter immune function in real time.\nLet me highlight the significance of these discoveries: For centuries, modern (Western) medicine considered these processes (circulatory system, immune system, sympathetic nervous system) autonomic or involuntary, meaning they are unable to be controlled consciously. Recent research has slipped this understanding upside down - essentially, deliberate breathing practice is a superpower.\nThere is incredible research on breathing methods/techniques beyond the scope of this article, spanning brain function, enlightened & hallucinogenic states, mood/emotion control, and more. We encourage you to explore it if you’re interested, and we hope to come back to the topic in a future article/series.\nThe first groundbreaking study was done on Wim “The Ice Man” Hof, himself. In 2011, researchers at Radboud University injected Wim Hof with endotoxin, a treated form of bacteria that triggers a general immune response, as Wim practiced his breathing technique. The results were astounding:\n\n…levels of inflammatory mediators in Hof’s blood were much lower. On average, Hof’s immune response was decreased by 50 percent compared to other healthy volunteers. In addition, hardly any flu-like symptoms were observed.\n\nAt first, this study was a target of skepticism. With a sample size of 1, it was unclear whether the results were reproducible or simply Wim Hof producing an outlier result as an individual. However, it was enough to encourage further exploration.\nIn 2014, a study published in the National Library of Medicine sought out to reproduce the 2011 results in average “healthy participants”. The intervention group was trained for just 10 minutes in Hof’s breathing technique, and then both groups were administered with the endotoxin.\n\nIn the intervention group, practicing the learned techniques resulted in intermittent respiratory alkalosis and hypoxia resulting in profoundly increased plasma epinephrine levels. In the intervention group, plasma levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 increased more rapidly after endotoxin administration, correlated strongly with preceding epinephrine levels, and were higher. Levels of proinflammatory mediators TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-8 were lower in the intervention group and correlated negatively with IL-10 levels. Finally, flu-like symptoms were lower in the intervention group.\n\nIn summary, the results were successfully reproduced, and the researchers concluded that it is possible to voluntarily activate the sympathetic nervous system and affect immune response through deliberate breathing technique.\nHof’s breathing technique shook the biomedical science industry again in 2018, this time after he showed humans can consciously enhance their ability to survive in extremely cold conditions (beyond what was previously thought possible). The study concluded that deliberate breathing technique resulted in “increased sympathetic innervation and glucose consumption in intercostal muscle, generating heat that dissipates to lung tissue and warms circulating blood in the pulmonary capillaries.”\n\n\n\nThe optimal, and most studied, approach entails complete submersion in cold water from the neck down. To sit in water from the chest down, with arms outstretched, for instance, precludes full stimulation of the stress response mechanisms which yield many of the advantages discussed in the previous two sections of this series.\nLikewise, although cold showers have demonstrated efficacy, they have not been subjected to the same level of scrutiny as cold water immersion from the neck down. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that the most optimal results may be obtained through full immersion in cold water. In the event that access to a cold bath is unattainable, cold showers serve as a reasonable alternative.\n\n\n\nThe short answer to this question is: uncomfortable but safe. Discomfort means that the beneficial stress hormones discussed in part 1 are being released in your system, thus offering the corresponding benefits.\nIf you are getting started, you may find that water temperatures around 45 degrees Fahrenheit is enough to feel uncomfortable. Over time, you are likely to find your cold immersion routine becomes easier. If you want to progress, and continue to extract maximum benefit, you must be honest with yourself to recognize whether you are pushing yourself, and increase intensity (decrease temperature) as appropriate.\n\n\n\nA study done by Scandinavian scientist Dr. Susanna Søeberg suggests the magic number is at least 11 minutes per week, total. This is the threshold needed to increase brown fat thermogenesis and metabolism. This could be done in various ways, such as spreading it out throughout the week or doing it all in one day.\n\n\n\nScience suggests that whether cold exposure is done in the morning or at night does not affect the health benefits discussed previously. However, I personally recommend doing your cold exposure first thing in the morning.\nThe reason why relates to internal body temperature and circadian rhythm. Your body is warm when it is awake, and cold when it is asleep. In fact, studies have shown your body temperature must decrease by 1.5 degrees in order to fall asleep.\nExposure to cold temperatures can cause your body to heat up afterwards, making it more difficult to fall asleep if done late at night. On the other hand, if performed early in the morning, cold exposure may boost your energy levels and start your day off on the right foot.\n\n\n\nThe Søeberg Principle, developed by Dr. Susana Søeberg, posits the following:\nTo enhance the metabolic effects of cold, force your body to reheat on its own\n\nEnd With Cold\n\nAdditionally, the act of shivering during or after cold exposure can further activate brown fat thermogenesis and release heat from muscles, resulting in heightened metabolic increases.\nTo increase shivering and optimize the metabolic benefits of cold exposure, individuals are advised to avoid huddling and wrapping their arms around themselves while in the cold or after exiting it. Likewise, entering a sauna after cold exposure, although relaxing, will limit the metabolic benefits of the cold.\nIf you want to go further, it is recommended to refrain from towel drying and instead allowing the body to naturally reheat and dry off. Admittedly, this is difficult, especially when it’s cold outside."

    "text": "Fluid Dynamics\n\n200 Years of the NAvier-Stokes Equation\n\n\nEnergetics of Turbulent Fluids\nEnergetics of Turbulent Fluids is a draft paper by Justin Beroz.\nHere are the notes I took while reading the paper:\n\n\nWhat is an eigenstate?\nIn quantum mechanics, an eigenstate is a state of a quantum system that, when acted upon by an operator, produces a multiple of itself. The multiple is called the eigenvalue. In other words, an eigenstate is a state that has a definite value for a particular observable quantity.\nFor example, the eigenstates of the position operator are all the possible states of a particle that have a definite position. The eigenstates of the momentum operator are all the possible states of a particle that have a definite momentum.\nEigenstates are important in quantum mechanics because they allow us to calculate the probabilities of different outcomes for measurements of observable quantities. For example, if we know the eigenstates of the position operator for a particle, we can calculate the probability of finding the particle at a particular location.\nEigenstates are also important in quantum computing because they can be used to store information. For example, if we know the eigenstates of the position operator for a particle, we can use the particle to store a bit of information by placing it in a particular location.\nHere are some examples of eigenstates:\n\nThe eigenstates of the position operator for a particle in a one-dimensional box are all the functions of the form sin(nπx/L), - where n is an integer and L is the length of the box.\nThe eigenstates of the momentum operator for a particle in a one-dimensional box are all the functions of the form exp(ipx/L), where p is a real number.\nThe eigenstates of the energy operator for a hydrogen atom are all the functions of the form ∣nlm⟩, where n, l, and m are integers. Eigenstates are a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics and they play an important role in many areas of physics, including quantum computing, quantum chemistry, and quantum field theory.\n\n\n\nWhat are the Navier-Stokes Equations?\nThe Navier-Stokes equations are a set of partial differential equations that describe the motion of viscous fluid substances. They were developed independently by French engineer and physicist Claude-Louis Navier and Anglo-Irish physicist and mathematician George Gabriel Stokes in the early 1800s. The equations are named after the two scientists.\nThe Navier-Stokes equations are a set of four equations, one for each of the three spatial dimensions and one for time. The equations relate the velocity, pressure, and density of the fluid to the forces acting on it. The equations are nonlinear, which means that they cannot be solved analytically in general. Instead, they must be solved numerically using computer simulations.\nThe Navier-Stokes equations are used in a wide variety of applications, including:\nAeronautics: The Navier-Stokes equations are used to design airplanes, helicopters, and other aircraft. Marine engineering: The Navier-Stokes equations are used to design ships, submarines, and other marine vessels. Civil engineering: The Navier-Stokes equations are used to design bridges, dams, and other structures that must withstand the forces of fluid flow. Meteorology: The Navier-Stokes equations are used to model weather patterns and predict the behavior of the atmosphere. Oceanography: The Navier-Stokes equations are used to model ocean currents and predict the behavior of the oceans. The Navier-Stokes equations are one of the most important equations in physics. They are essential for understanding the motion of fluids, and they have a wide range of applications in engineering, meteorology, oceanography, and other fields.\nThe Navier-Stokes equations are a Millennium Prize Problem, which means that the Clay Mathematics Institute has offered a $1,000,000 prize for the first correct solution to the problem. The problem is still unsolved, and it is one of the most difficult problems in mathematics.\n\n\nWhat is the Kolmogorov energy cascade?\nThe Kolmogorov energy cascade is a theory that describes the transfer of energy from large scales to small scales in turbulent flows. The theory was developed by Andrey Kolmogorov in the 1940s.\nThe Kolmogorov energy cascade is based on the following assumptions:\nThe turbulent flow is statistically homogeneous and isotropic. This means that the statistical properties of the flow are the same in all directions and at all points in the flow. The turbulent flow is in equilibrium. This means that the rate of energy input to the flow is equal to the rate of energy dissipation. The Kolmogorov energy cascade is a process by which energy is transferred from large scales to small scales in turbulent flows. The process is driven by the nonlinear interactions between the turbulent eddies. The large eddies break up into smaller eddies, which in turn break up into even smaller eddies. This process continues until the eddies are so small that they are dissipated by viscosity.\nThe Kolmogorov energy cascade is a very important process in turbulent flows. It is responsible for the mixing of fluids, the transport of heat and momentum, and the generation of sound. The Kolmogorov energy cascade is also a very complex process, and there is still much that is not understood about it.\nThe Kolmogorov energy cascade is named after Andrey Kolmogorov, a Russian mathematician who developed the theory in the 1940s. Kolmogorov was a pioneer in the study of turbulence, and his work has had a profound impact on our understanding of this complex phenomenon."

Solid solution series occur when two or more different elements can substitute for each other in a mineral’s structure to a significant degree. Here, the variable x represents a range of compositions that can exist within this series.\nThe formula indicates that for every 6 units of phosphate (PO4) and one oxygen (O), there are 10-x lead (Pb) atoms and x copper (Cu) atoms. The “x” in the formula implies that the copper content can vary, essentially representing a range of similar minerals with varying amounts of copper and lead. As the copper content increases (x increases), the lead content decreases correspondingly.\nPlease note that this is a general explanation and the specifics of the mineral can vary greatly depending on its formation conditions and geological setting.\nIf you want to understand this equation thoroughly, you would need to delve into crystal chemistry and solid state physics.\nCrystal Chemistry: The substitution of Pb by Cu is possible due to similarities in their ionic radii and charge. Minerals form in specific crystalline structures and the substitution of one atom for another depends on these factors.\nSolid State Physics: The physical properties of this mineral series, such as its electrical conductivity or magnetic properties, would vary based on the exact ratio of Pb to Cu. Understanding these properties requires knowledge of solid state physics."

It’s not that the steel produced before these explosions is stronger or of better quality, but it’s that the steel manufactured after the start of the atomic age is slightly radioactive.\nIn 1945, when the first atomic bombs were detonated during World War II, they released various radionuclides, including Carbon-14 and other radioactive isotopes, into the atmosphere. These isotopes circled the globe and were incorporated into many things, including the iron ore used to produce steel. As a result, steel produced after 1945 can exhibit slight radioactivity.\nThis can be an issue in certain sensitive applications where even the tiniest amount of background radiation can interfere with equipment operation or measurements, like Geiger counters, certain medical equipment, and scientific devices used in physics and geology. For these uses, pre-war or low-background steel, typically salvaged from pre-1945 ships and buildings, is often sought.\n\n\nResearch\n\nLow-Background Steel Wiki\nReadiation Damage Wiki\nRadiation Effects in Steel\nInvestigation of Natural Radioactivity and Dose Assessment over Steel Making Region\nEffects of Irradiation on Mechanical Properties\nIs neutron radiation exposure always detrimental to metals (steels)?\nEffects of Radiation Damage"

    "text": "Project White Hot\nPROJECT ‘WHITE HOT’ Mission Assessment of Recovered Lenticular Aerodyne Objects\nGeneral Nathan Twining Briefing document for President Eisenhower\nPART 1. PROJECT WHITE HOT INTELLIGENCE ESTIMATE (PRELIMINARY)\nLANDING ZONE NO, 1 Socorro, New Mexico–the unidentified lenticular-shaped Aerodyne which has been designated ULAT-1, has been evaluated as a non air breathing aircraft of unknown origin. Totally lacking conventional wing, fuselage, nacelle, control, and fuel systems strongly indicates it is not Russian.\nConsultation with Paperclip specialists concur. Aerodynamic features exhibited in ULAT-1 represents a very high degree of engineering and sophistication not seen in this country.\nDimensional homogeneity study cannot explain how this craft sustains load and lift factors necessary for flight.\nThe power plant does not even remotely resemble any conventional type now in use. Lacking any discernible intake or exhaust features, it is the opinion of AMC and ONR that this craft was designed to operate outside of the earth’s atmosphere.\nThe unconventional conclusions reached by members of this fact finding mission remain tentative at this time. Some members have expressed the view that ULAT-1 may be the product of an advanced culture from another planet that is much older than ours and has utilized their science and intellect for interplanetary space travel. It is not precisely known if the occupants purposely had the objective of exploration and of curiosity or with the intent of surveying for other reasons. So far, no hostile action or intent has been observed since they made their presence known.\nGiven the fact that our atomic bomb tests, atmospheric exploration with rockets, and XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXed in New Mexico, could have precipitated the events that led to the incident and subsequent actions taken by the military.\nOperating under the assumption that the fallen object was a long-range Russian reconnaissance platform collecting aerial photographic intelligence data military intelligence personnel were a instructed to secure the craft, debris and any occupants as rapidly as possible.\nConcerns over possible exposure to civilian of unknown biological and chemical agents dictated the quarantine measures taken.\nRadiation hazards were assumed and protective measures were taken as well.\nIn the interest or National Security priorities it was necessary to detain civilian witnesses for interrogation to satisfy intelligence requirements and quash rumors that could alert potential espionage agents known to be in the vicinity.\nSeveral bodies were discovered.\nBecause on-site medical personnel were unsure of the physiological make up of the occupants, special preparations and preservation methods were employed. Autopsy information obtained so far suggests that the occupants mimic the features associated with Orientals.\nOutwardly, they appear human-like with but one exception, autopsy notes mention a rarely observed XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXs present which supports the premise that these beings originate from another planet.\nPART TWO TECHNICAL EVALUATION (PRELIMINARY) ULAT-1\nUpon close examination of the exterior surfaces of the craft’s fuselage, metallurgists found the the skin to be of a ferrous metal white in color. The metal exhibits all the characteristics of high grade steel. It was determined that the steel was cold-formed and heat created.\n\nTensile strength was estimated in excess of 50,000 pounds per square inch. Shear tests give the metal a durability rating above 175,000 pounds per square inch, making this fuselage extremely strong and heat resistant.\nStatic and pressure flow simulations were impressive. The low profile ration of 6-1 gives the aerodyne a great advantage in overcoming the restrictions of the boundary layer effect in high performance operations.\nSpan flanges are constructed in unusual kinematic design which is believed to allow strain relief at supersonic speeds. There were no visible signs of plate-stiffeners, there were no fasteners, weld, rivets, or fittings, holding the fuselage together.\nLack of wings, flaps, stabilizers, and surface central features, suggests that the craft is a lifting body.\nThere are no air intakes for exhaust.\nThere are no cables\nThere are no identifiable electronics (wiring, ignition, lights, instrument, compartment, engine, motors, vacuum tubes, solenoids, generators, heaters, etc.)\nThe power-plant, (severely damaged) XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXx neutronic engine. XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXx detected heavy water and deuterium (light hydrogen) elements appeared to be the primary ignitor. A series of coils and heavy magnets connected to the neutronic engine via an oddly arranged group of electrodes (actually not yet identified) appears to be the active force. One small motor was examined. It is encased in a pure aluminium capsule directly underneath the main compartment. There is a small exhaust aperture attached that was what can only be described as an helicoid mechanism XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX. The auxiliary motor may be articulated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNavigation and engine controls may be activated by tactile manipulation. Viewing may have been achieved by form of television imagery. Symbolic notation appears to be the form of flight and control indicators. Flat panels of unknown metal has been suggested as a device associated with the operation of the aerodyne was discovered and analyzed. It’s mode of operation and purpose is unknown.\nThe absence of provisions, berthing compartments and storage areas, suggest the notion that this craft may be a short range reconnaissance platform. The only recognizable features XXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\nMode of operation of operation is believed to be instrumentation and suggests that the aerodyne from reconstruction from available wreckage XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX biosensory and optical stimuli for these reasons:\n\nabsence of indicator signals Absence of any circular dials Absence of linear dials or moving pointers Absence of counters Absence of scopes No mechanical signal indicators 12. There were identifiable control types found among the assortment of artefacts that would indicate the operation of the propulsion unit was manually activated – no knobs, push buttons, toggle switches, levers, balls, handwheels, hand-cranks, or foot pedals were observed in the interior space of the flight cabin.\n\nThe apparent lack of additional clothing and equipment reinforces the belief that the occupants were engaged in a purely exploratory flight.\nIt is not presently known if electromagnetic radiation effects from the power plant had contributed to pilot error or death before impact. If inadequate shielding was the primary cause of pilot error XXXXXXXXXXXXXXs detected.\nIt is believed by some of the crash inspection personnel that sudden decompression and change in atmospheric pressure may have contributed to pilot error. Clothing removed from occupants do not resemble any pressure suit currently being tested by the Army or the Navy for high altitude experiments. Since temperature and humidity factors for the occupants is unknown, it is impossible to determine if decompression and temperature changed affected circulatory and dexterity functions. Although it is believed the occupants may have been overcome by some yet undiscovered pollutant or noxious fumes originating inside the craft.\nRotation or rapid oscillation could have been a contributing factor in pilot error. It is not known if organic effects played a part either since medical data is non-existent in which to make any judgment as to exact cause of death or machine failure.\nThe most probable cause of the crash is believed to be excessive acceleration combined with steep descent. The seating arrangement was transversely designed about the vertical axis of the occupants in a positive direction of flight. The panels removed from the craft resemble the ones taken from the occupants, suggesting a symbionic relationship between operator and the function of the aerodyne’s operation. A very tentative working theory was expressed by the scientific members of the inspection team that pilot-aerodyne interaction may occur via electronic-nonword symbols perceived through the tactile manipulation of the fingers feeding impulses to the brain and visa versa. All of which may suggest a non-inert quality or the materials existent as being a product or artificial intelligence.\nThe following elements were analyzed and found to exist in the small neutronic power plant that was found inside ULAT-l:\n\n\nUF6 in metallic form;\nhydrogen-fluoride gas;\nwater and uranium tetra fluoride;\npowdered magnesium and potassium chlorate,\nmetal similar to lead with a chocolate brown color;\nU-235 in metallic form;\nplastic-like material similar to NE 102,\nBeryllium,\nPure aluminium;\nThorium isotope material;\nPlutonium powder.\n\n\nScientists from Los Alamos and Sandia Base were alarmed that the power plant could possibly function as a bomb if the elements described above were processed in similar fashion as was done for the lens and shot-gun detonators. This originally was the first conclusion. After further evaluation, it was determined that since no recognizable firing circuits were identified, the threat or detonation did not exist.\nThe only evidence or circuitry found on the motor was thin plastic-like sheets fashioned like platters embossed on the exterior of the spherically-shaped casing coated by a thin film or pure silver. Under high power magnification it was observed a series of fine grid-like lines intersecting groups of dots arranged in circular patterns.\n\nPART III SCIENTIFIC PROBABILITIES\n\nBased on all available evidence collected from recovered exhibits currently under study by AHC, AFSWP, NEPA, AEC, ONA, NACA, JBDB, RAND, USAAF SAG. and MIT, are deemed extraterrestrial in nature. This conclusion was reached as a result of comparisons of artifacts XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX discovery in 1941. The technology is outside the scope of US science, even that of German rocket and aircraft development.\nInterplanetary space travel is possible provided adequate funding, necessary resources are made available, and national interest is piqued.\nOur solar system is not unique. Chances are favorable for intelligent life on other planets notwithstanding similar development not unlike our own.\nBeing that our culture is relatively young (in relation to the cosmic scale), it is possible that other cultures may have developed faster, or are much older and have avoided the pitfalls common in our historical and scientific development.\nHuman origins may not be constrained to one planet. Our genus may be found among solar systems similar to our own.\nThe laws of physics and genetics may have a genesis in a higher, structured order than once previously thought.\n\nPART IV POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS\nGiven the existing political climate in the US and the unstable conditions in Europe, it is the considered opinion of the members, that if the Administration went public with the information as found in this report now, the results would be damaging, even fatal to the world Political structure as it now exists. The following considerations were reviewed and debated, which led the mission to the following opinions:\n\nPublic trust of the political institutions may be eroded and possibly be held in disrepute.\nA complete revisioning make take place as institutions of higher learning thus calling into question the certainty of scientific knowledge.\nThe ability of the Armed Forces to secure National Security would be put in jeopardy and possibly lead to undue public fear and disorder.\nHistory and religion in the political context would probably suffer the most damage causing unprecedented upheaval in social and psychological well-being.\nPolitical repercussions may occur in our diplomatic efforts of containing the Communist threat to our democratic interests.\nIf such an announcement were made by the current Administration, it could be perceived by opposing party as a trick, laying open to accusations of unethetical (sic) posturing and manipulation of the public’s mind.\n\nPART V NATIONAL SECURITY STRUCTURE\nWith the passage of the National Security Act of 1947 XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXas presented an unprecedented situation regarding maintaining secrecy related to the information contained in this report.\nIn the early months of 1942, up until the present, intrusions of unidentified aircraft have occasionally been documented, but there has been no serious investigations by the intelligence arm of the Government. Even the recovery case of 1941 did not create a unified intelligence effort to exploit possible technological gains with the exception of the Manhattan Project. We now have an opportunity to extend our technology beyond the threshold that we have achieved, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX. Aside from technological gains, we face an even greater challenge, that of learning the intent of such a presence. There are questions that remain unanswered, such as: What forces face us? What kind of defense do we have? Where do they come from and what kind of weapons do they possess? Where can we stage our forces in advance, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX How wide a front? How many craft can we expect? And XXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\nThe members of the mission are prepared to submit a separate report on just this problem alone. And it would take a dozen volumes to explain how these problems should be met.\nOur only point, however, is that a combined intelligence and research operation would be a vast, intricate, covertly planned marshaling of resources, human and material, to solve a specific, clearly defined problem.\nWe have to find effective methods of persuasion with other government agencies without creating a sense of impending doom. The first task is to carefully appraise the problem. The second is to evaluate the known resources and probable strategy of the visitors. The third is to inventory our own ways and means, ascertain how much resources we can bring to bear, and how fast. The third is to devise our strategic plan. And last is to work out with infinite pains the tactical details and the myriad secondary problems of funding and security.\nIt is the unanimous opinion of the members that Operation MAJESTIC TWELVE be a fully funded ant operational TOP SECRET Research and Development intelligence gathering agency. It is also recommended that a panel of experts be appointed to chair and oversee the functions and operations of said agency. It’s members should have appropriate security clearances and full cooperation XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXX the National Security Council, the Pentagon, XXXXXXXht, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX Joint Intelligence Committee, Joint Intelligence Objectives Agency, Central Intelligence Agency, Atomic Energy Commission, Joint Research and Development Board, Army Security Agency, and the National Advisory Board on Aeronautics.\nXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXgy are highlighted:\n\nPropeller driven bomber aircraft and jet engines, armed with conventional and atomic bombs.\nJet fighter aircraft, including some of super­sonic speed, armed with rockets and guns.\nPropeller-driven aircraft, valued for their endurance. .\nGuided anti-aircraft missiles, and radar-guided anti-aircraft guns.\nShort and medium-range guided missiles. Drone aircraft.\nAtomic charges, in bombs, missiles and torpedoes.\n\nIn the arena of nuclear weapons we feel there is a certain advantage to be gained XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX. It is speculated by some that if reduced size and miniature circuitry were introduced into the proposed hydrogen bomb program, it would give US Strategic Air Forces a great deterrence capability over the Russians. Current studies at MIT of micro-electronics taken from ULAT-1 may give us the strategic advantage so desired. It is strongly recommended that funding be allocated in this area.\nThere is a good chance that the Russians may try to make use of the flying saucer scare by public news media and diplomatic means of a technological breakthrough in aircraft and missile development. We feel that such a disclosure would certainly cause great embarrassment to our elected officials and to the military, not to mention the panic felt by the citizenry. To counter such a threat, it is recommended that a counterintelligence program be drawn up and held in abeyance if at such time the situation should present itself. It might be suggested that we should make a preempted use of these objects for the purpose of psychological warfare once the true nature of these objects are known and understood.\nTo further assist and aid all MAJCOM in the US and overseas, it is recommended that a standard intelligence reporting system be implemented through standard reporting channels with technical data forwarding instructions. At present, there are no specific intelligence guidelines available to military commanders in dealing with sightings and material evidence collection. It would be advisable for the respective Secretaries of the Armed Forces to devise a security policy of plausible denial, if and when the public becomes aware of the reality of these objects and the interest of the military of such incidents.\nIn conclusion, for reasons of national security and the public well being, the US must be perceived as being the top of the heap and every effort must be made to insure that there is, and never has been, a threat to the country."

Its greater sophistication affords it vastly greater destructive power than first-generation nuclear bombs, a more compact size, a lower mass, or a combination of these benefits. Characteristics of nuclear fusion reactions make possible the use of non-fissile depleted uranium as the weapon’s main fuel, thus allowing more efficient use of scarce fissile material such as uranium-235 \\((^{235}U)\\) or plutonium-239 \\((^{239}Pu)\\)\nThe first full-scale thermonuclear test was carried out by the United States in 1952; the concept has since been employed by most of the world’s nuclear powers in the design of their weapons.\nModern fusion weapons consist essentially of two main components: a nuclear fission primary stage (fueled by \\(^{235}U\\) or \\(^{239}Pu\\)) and a separate nuclear fusion secondary stage containing thermonuclear fuel: the heavy hydrogen isotopes deuterium and tritium, or in modern weapons lithium deuteride. For this reason, thermonuclear weapons are often colloquially called hydrogen bombs or H-bombs."

Thus then spacetime gets extremly curved. But if we assume that spacetime remains flat, then we have to rewrite this as what is the local light propagation velocity tensor. Under that assumption this velocity will become equal to the EH surface for a location at the EH. Because still remains valid that nothing can exceed the local speed of light, this means that all matter will come at rest at the EH with every particle wave function frozen on that surface. Nothing ever traverses the EH. All accumulates on it. The BH grows by accumulating frozen matter at its EH surface.\nExactly. In other words, if you take the reference frame of light, you’ll see that the EH is pushed to oo, and all matter will be contained between the photon horizon (r=3M) and the EH (r=2M). (Is our universe rotating?)\nYou can’t take the reference frame of light. In every reference frame the light speed is the same, so “in the reference frame of light” makes no sense because there time is stopped. The EH can’t be seen on oo because for an observer between PS and EH there are a finite number of oscillations of his time reference from PS to EH. The assumption that the universe could rotate leads to a complication of all physical laws. We would get that there then has to be a rotation axis of the universe and that all rules are different with relation to that axis so that speed along the rotation direction can exceed c with any multiple without problems of inertia. This is similar to the Hubble expansion with the difference of an absolute rotation axis. That is why I reject both assumptions. It makes no sense to assume that space rotates. We rotate inside space. It also makes no sense to assume that space expands. We shrink inside space. The big one, space, is invariant, flat, not rotating, not translating, not curving. The small, what is inside space, rotates, translates, changes size. The only property of space that has a variation is that the propagation speed of light depends on the mass/energy density distribution in space.\nIsn’t it easier for Hawking radiation to escape if black holes have hair? So it’s not perfectly curved there. How does this equation differ from the superfluid quantum gravity spinning vortice(s) model of black holes?\n@bgreene marveled about the beauty of the equation. He didn’t gave a judgement about its validity. I gave an explanation on what assumptions are needed to allow this metric equation to be applicable. You come with the concept of a radiating BH. That only asks wether a particle pair of matter and antimatter could split such that one falks into, and one escapes the BH. But since the propagation speed of light at the EH is equal to the EH nothing moves there. So a hairy EH would assume that this propagation speed distribution is not smooth. This then should lead to particle wave functions to start from “stand still” and move outward. Such phenomen would need a different metric equation, but would not alter the beauty of the equation that @bgreene mentioned."

Almost half a century ago, Yang and Mills introduced a remarkable new framework to describe elementary particles using structures that also occur in geometry. Quantum Yang-Mills theory is now the foundation of most of elementary particle theory, and its predictions have been tested at many experimental laboratories, but its mathematical foundation is still unclear. The successful use of Yang-Mills theory to describe the strong interactions of elementary particles depends on a subtle quantum mechanical property called the “mass gap”: the quantum particles have positive masses, even though the classical waves travel at the speed of light. This property has been discovered by physicists from experiment and confirmed by computer simulations, but it still has not been understood from a theoretical point of view. Progress in establishing the existence of the Yang-Mills theory and a mass gap will require the introduction of fundamental new ideas both in physics and in mathematics."

Scientists have discovered new forms of synchronization, called chimeras, that are more complex and intricate than previously known patterns. Chimeras are characterized by the coexistence of synchronized and unsynchronized regions in a single system. The discovery of chimeras has opened up new possibilities for understanding and controlling synchronization in a wide range of real-world systems. For example, chimeras could be used to design new communication networks that are more robust to noise and disruptions. The article also discusses the history of synchronization research and the challenges that scientists face in understanding and predicting the behavior of synchronized systems. It concludes by discussing the potential applications of chimeras in a variety of fields, including biology, engineering, and economics.\nThe discovery of chimeras was made possible by advances in computational power and mathematical modeling. Chimeras have been observed in a variety of natural systems, including fireflies, heart cells, and neural networks. Scientists are still learning about the rules that govern the formation and behavior of chimeras. Chimeras have the potential to be used to design new communication networks, control traffic flow, and improve the efficiency of energy systems."

    "text": "1999\nNvidia released the GeForce 256 graphics card\n\nprocessor 17mm transistors\nfabbed by TSMC\n\nCalled it the first graphics processing unit, “a single chip processor with integrated transform, lighting, triangle setup/clipping, and rendering engines that is capable of processing a minimum of 10mm polygons per second”.\n\n\nThe Graphics Pipeline\nJob is to turn a scene into graphics: Geometry.\nEarly real-time graphics systems broke everything down into triangles.\n\nYou start with 3D coordinate data and 3D shape data: scene-level calculations.\nThen geometry stage: transform & lighting, and triangle setup and clipping (clipping when objects are overlayed). Matrices are used when manipulating these coordinates.\nRendering Stage: pipeline fills the translated 2D image with image pixels representing the object’s surface. Setup engine passes render engine information about the objects color and texture and how those are affected by lighting and perspective.\n\nUntil 1996, Nvidia did only the Rendering stage, with the rest done by the CPU. But then it began moving up the chain.\nIn 1997, Nvidia cards took on triangle setup and clipping. This allowed the CPU to spend more time on the geometry stage. So it threw more triangles at the graphics card, the card became the bottleneck. Nvidia engineers solved it with parallelism, converting work into a pipeline of sequential steps, and lined up multiple pipelines to run in parallel. Tasks were repetitive and data independent, speed was almost linearly proportional to number of processing cores.\nIn 1999, Nvidia then took up the last part of the graphics pipeline, transform & lighting calculations (with the GeForce 256). This generation of GPUs ran what was called “fixed function” pipelines. Once programmer sent data to GPU, it could not be modified. This prevented developers from using new features in graphics APIs.\nThe ability to introduce additional customizability came with the GeForce3 in 2001. Devs could not send customized programs called shaders. Shaders were written in low-level language and had limits.\n2006, Nvidia released GeForce 8 series and new software framework called Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) offered a lot to make programming GPUs easier. Open Source cousin was called OpenCL.\n\nA kernel is executed as a grid of thread blocks.\nA thread block is a batch of threads that can cooperate with each other by\n\nsharing data through a shared memory\nsynchronizing their execution\n\nThreads from different blocks cannot cooperate\n\nThis turned specialized game machines into generalized processors. GPU performance has scaled far better than CPUs recently, because NVIDIA can scale performance by increasing amount of transistors. Nvidia was also able to scale frequency, using TMSC 16nm newly designed transistor using the 3D FinFET architecture for the first time (higher clock speed). Dennard scaling law says new chips use the same amount of energy despite having more transistors on the same sized space. Slowed in 2006 but still happens.\nImageNET started in 2010 as a competition for image classification. The top performing models used hand engineered computer vision models. Error rate of 29 and 25%.\nThen in 2012, 3 researchers Slex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey Hinton participated with a deep neural network. Trained in 5-6 days on 2 GTX 580 3GB GPUs, it took first place by a mile with a 15% error rate, 10% better than runner up. 2016, Google Deepmind’s AlphaGo beat the world champion.\nAMD bought Nvidia competitor ATI, and made a CUDA of their own called ROCm, opting to make it open source."

    "text": "Attention: A Huge Leap\nIn 2014, an Attention mechanism was introduced by Dzmitry Bahdanau, Kyunghyun Cho, and Yoshua Bengio. This became the foundation for the Transformer. - Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate - ffective Approaches to Attention-based Neural Machine Translation\nThe attention mechanism allows the model to assign different weights or importance to different parts of the input sequence when making predictions or generating output. Instead of relying solely on fixed-length vector representations or encoding the entire input sequence into a fixed-length representation, the attention mechanism enables the model to dynamically attend to relevant parts of the input at each step of the computation.\nIn a typical attention mechanism, there are three main components:\n\nQuery: A query represents the current step or position in the output generation process. It is used to compare against different parts of the input sequence to determine their relevance.\nKey: The keys are representations of the different parts of the input sequence. These keys are compared to the query to measure their similarity or relevance.\nValue: The values are additional information associated with the input sequence parts. They provide the context or content that the model focuses on.\n\nThe attention mechanism computes a similarity score between the query and each key, which determines the relevance or attention assigned to the corresponding value. These similarity scores are typically computed using dot products, additive or multiplicative operations, or neural networks.\nThe resulting attention weights are used to weight the values associated with the input sequence parts. This weighted information is then combined or aggregated to provide a context-aware representation for the current step, allowing the model to focus more on relevant parts of the input.\nBy incorporating attention mechanisms into deep learning models, they can effectively capture dependencies between different elements of the input sequence, improve performance on sequential tasks, and handle long-range dependencies more effectively than traditional fixed-length representations."

Clang is a compiler front end for the C, C++, Objective-C, and Objective-C++ programming languages. It uses the LLVM compiler infrastructure as its back end and is designed to act as a drop-in replacement for the GCC (GNU Compiler Collection).\nSome features and characteristics of clang++ and the Clang project include:\n\nPerformance: Clang aims to provide faster compile times than other compilers, like GCC, especially in incremental builds.\nDiagnostics: Clang is known for its clear and concise diagnostics (error and warning messages). It often provides a more detailed explanation and sometimes even suggests fixes for the issues.\nModular Design: Clang is designed to be highly modular, which has facilitated tools built on top of it. This design is particularly beneficial for creating custom tooling around the compiler.\nCompatibility: Clang aims to be compatible with GCC, meaning that most GCC-valid code should compile with Clang without changes.\nIntegrated Static Analyzer: Clang includes a static analysis tool that can detect various types of bugs in the source code.\n\nTo use clang++ to compile a C++ program, you might issue a command like:\nclang++ -o my_program my_program.cpp\nWhere -o my_program specifies the name of the output executable and my_program.cpp is the source file to be compiled.\n\n\n\nLanguages\n\nInterpreted Languages vs Compiled Languages\n\nA language must be interpreted to yield an output.

    "text": "Glossary\n\nEVM vs LLVM\nThe Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is not based on LLVM. They are designed for different purposes, and their architectures and functionalities reflect these distinct goals.\n\nEVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine):\n\nThe EVM is a stack-based virtual machine designed to execute bytecode produced by the compilation of smart contracts written in higher-level languages like Solidity or Vyper. These smart contracts run on the Ethereum blockchain.\nThe EVM operates in a sandboxed environment, ensuring that smart contracts cannot affect the host system or other contracts negatively. It also has a unique gas-based execution model, where every operation consumes a certain amount of “gas” to prevent infinite loops or overly resource-consuming operations.\n\nLLVM:\n\nLLVM, on the other hand, is a compiler framework designed to generate optimized machine code for a wide range of architectures from higher-level languages like C, C++, Rust, and others.\nIt’s modular, allowing for various optimizations and transformations on its intermediate representation (IR) before the code is finally compiled to machine code for specific architectures.\n\n\nWhile the EVM and LLVM are designed for different purposes and do not share a direct relationship, there have been some projects and discussions in the Ethereum community about leveraging LLVM tools or components for specific tasks. For example:\n\neWASM (Ethereum WebAssembly): Ethereum has considered a shift from its current EVM bytecode to a WebAssembly-based system called eWASM. WebAssembly (Wasm) has some ties to the LLVM ecosystem, as LLVM can be used to compile code to Wasm. While eWASM would bring Ethereum closer to technologies associated with LLVM, it’s not a direct usage of LLVM in the EVM.\nSOLL Project: There was a project known as SOLL that aimed to use LLVM to compile Solidity and YUL (an intermediate language for Ethereum) into EVM and eWASM bytecode. It was more of an experimental endeavor and wasn’t a mainstream compiler choice for Ethereum developers.\n\nIn summary, while the core EVM isn’t based on LLVM or directly inspired by it, the broader Ethereum ecosystem has explored and continues to explore synergies with LLVM and related technologies.\n\n\nSandboxed VMs\nCertainly! Let’s start with a foundational understanding of “sandboxing” and then delve into an example comparing a non-sandboxed VM to the EVM.\nSandboxing is a security mechanism used to run code in a restricted environment, isolating it from the broader system. In this isolated space, the code’s potential to cause harm or interfere with other processes is severely limited. The sandbox acts like a protective bubble that restricts access to system resources, data, and functionalities.\n\n\nNon-Sandboxed VM: Java Virtual Machine (JVM)\nWhile the JVM has security mechanisms and can run code in a sandboxed environment (especially applets in older web browsers), it can also run non-sandboxed applications. This means Java applications, when given permissions, can access the filesystem, network, and more.\nMalicious Example in a Non-Sandboxed JVM Environment:\nSuppose you download a Java application and run it without any security restrictions. This application contains the following code snippet:\nimport java.io.*;\npublic class MaliciousApp {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        try {\n            File file = new File(\"/important/system/file.txt\");\n            if (file.delete()) {\n                System.out.println(\"File deleted successfully\");\n            } else {\n                System.out.println(\"Failed to delete the file\");\n            }\n        } catch (Exception e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n}\nThis Java application attempts to delete an “important” system file. If run without restrictions, it can harm or disrupt the system.\n\n\nSandboxed VM: Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)\nThe EVM is designed explicitly to be sandboxed. Smart contracts on the Ethereum network can only perform a set of predefined operations and cannot directly access the system’s resources, such as the filesystem, network, or other external entities, except through the defined Ethereum protocol.\nWhy the Malicious Code Can’t Affect the Host in EVM:\nLet’s assume a similar intention with a hypothetical smart contract trying to delete a file from the system:\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\n\ncontract MaliciousContract {\n    function deleteFile() public {\n        // Hypothetical and invalid code\n        system(\"rm /important/system/file.txt\");\n    }\n}\nThis code won’t work in EVM because:\n\nThe EVM doesn’t have a system call or anything similar.\nSmart contracts can’t directly access the host file system, network, or other system resources.\nThe EVM can only do what’s defined in the Ethereum protocol, such as transfer ether, emit events, and interact with other contracts.\n\nThe EVM’s sandboxing ensures that, regardless of the intentions of the smart contract, it cannot do anything outside its defined capabilities. Even if a contract is maliciously designed or has a vulnerability, the damage is generally limited to the contract’s logic or its interactions within the Ethereum ecosystem, rather than the broader system running the EVM."

    "section": "Background",
    "text": "Background\nFTX was a centralized exchange (CEX) founded by Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), who also co-founded Alameda Research, a crypto hedge fund. Both of these companies declared bankruptcy in Q4 2022. Prior to its bankruptcy, the FTX trading platform was one of the most popular choices amongst crypto traders. Its rise to fame could be attributed to several factors, including SBF’s Jane Street background and being the world’s youngest billionaire. FTX’s marketing also played a huge role in attracting users, promoting its low fees and collaborating with A-list celebrities such as Tom Brady to gain market attention.\nHowever, despite all its efforts and fame, FTX filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Nov 11, 2022, and SBF was arrested on Dec 12, 2022. The collapse of FTX had a significant impact, rippling through the entire crypto market, triggering liquidations and causing even more companies to fall. Yet despite this havoc, it seems FTX might be launching version 2.0.\nIn this article, we’ll be exploring how the FTX exchange fell, take a look at the potential FTX 2.0 and identify the possible effects it might have on the FTT token’s price.\nKey Takeaways:\n\nFTX was a centralized exchange founded in May 2019 by Sam Bankman-Fried and Gary Wang. The exchange declared bankruptcy in Q4 2022.\nJohn Ray, the new CEO of FTX, has set up a task force to relaunch FTX, and is calling the exchange FTX 2.0.\nFTT’s price experienced a surge following the revelation of FTX 2.0 documents on Twitter by Ray.\nBybit offers the FTT/USDT Spot trading pair.\n\n\nWhat Was the FTX Crypto Exchange?\nAs mentioned earlier on, FTX was a CEX founded in May 2019 by SBF and Gary Wang, who also served as its Chief Technology Officer (CTO). The cryptocurrency exchange specialized in derivatives and leveraged products, on top of providing spot markets. At the beginning of 2022, FTX had amassed more than a million registered users, and was recording billions of dollars in daily trading volume. One of FTX’s key innovations was its FTT token.\n\nWhat Is FTT?\nFTT is an ERC-20 token issued on the Ethereum network. Much effort was put into making FTT less inflationary, with FTX regularly repurchasing FTT tokens and conducting FTT token burns. Both of these processes reduced the circulating supply of FTT in the market, which in turn decreased the level of selling pressure. The repurchase of FTT was made possible by using 33% of the trading fees generated on FTX.\nIn addition to reducing selling pressure, FTX also increased buying pressure by offering users a discount on trading fees and tighter spreads when they held FTT. For active traders, this was a very attractive value proposition for holding onto FTT, as it could offer savings of up to 60%. Furthermore, FTT could be used as collateral for future positions, increasing the utility of the token and further incentivizing people to purchase and hold the token.\nOther benefits of FTT included serving as a form of insurance, protecting traders from clawback. This was an extremely useful feature, especially during periods of volatile markets which increased the chances of traders’ margin calls being triggered. FTT holders could also stake the token, which entitled them to free withdrawals of ERC-20 tokens from the FTX platform. This was particularly helpful during periods of Ethereum network congestion, which can lead to skyrocketing gas fees.\n\n\n\nFTX’s Collapse\nHow did a platform with such a high level of innovations end up bankrupt? Let’s take a look at the series of events leading up to FTX’s bankruptcy and SBF’s arrest.\n\nNovember 2017: Founding of Alameda Research\nAlameda Research, a quantitative trading firm, is founded by SBF, who rises to fame through his highly profitable arbitrage trading on the Kimchi Premium.\n\n\nMay 2019: Founding of FTX\nFTX’s CEX is founded, with a focus on derivative products.\n\n\nDecember 2019: Binance’s Investment Into FTX\nBinance announces a strategic investment into FTX.\n\n\n2021: Binance Sells FTX Equity in Exchange for FTT and USD\nWith this transfer, Binance receives $2.1 billion worth of FTT and USD.\n\n\nNov 2, 2022\nCoinDesk reveals a document, supposedly Alameda Research’s balance sheet, with concerns that some of Alameda Research’s assets are commingled with FTX, even though these two are meant to be separate entities. In particular, it’s found that $5.8 billion of the $14.6 billion worth of assets in Alameda Research’s balance sheet is in the FTX-issued token, FTT.\nGiven that FTT was sold to Alameda Research at a very low price early on in the establishment of FTX, the artificial inflation of FTT by FTX gave Alameda Research an opportunity to use their FTT holdings as collateral to borrow other assets from FTX’s customer deposits.\n\n\nNov 6, 2022\nBinance’s founder, Changpeng Zhao (known as CZ), announces on Twitter that Binance will sell all its FTT holdings. This sends the broader crypto market into a frenzy, with speculation regarding FTX and Alameda Research’s insolvency. In turn, this causes a massive sell-off of the FTT token, and FTX begins to see users withdraw their assets.\n\n\nNov 7, 2022\nCaroline Ellison, CEO of Alameda Research, takes to Twitter to highlight that Alameda Research would be willing to buy over CZ’s share of FTT at $22 per token. This further spurs the market’s speculation that FTT has been heavily used for collateral by Alameda Research, and that any price drop below $22 could potentially trigger liquidations.\nCZ rejects the sale of FTT to Alameda Research; the market is convinced that CZ is out to cause the death of FTT. Given that FTT has had a low circulating liquidity since Alameda Research holds most of the circulating supply, Alameda isn’t able to sell off their FTT since there would be insufficient market liquidity to buy up their tokens.\nWith nonstop user withdrawal from FTX amounting to $6 billion, FTX is left with no choice but to halt their withdrawals, and announce that they’re suffering from a liquidity crisis. The cause of this insolvency is that customers whose deposits have been loaned to Alameda Research have had their positions liquidated as a result of FTT’s price decline.\n\n\nNov 8, 2022\nBinance stepped in shortly after, announcing that they had signed a non-binding letter of intent (LOI) to acquire FTX international. This is, however, subject to due diligence, and Binance will first be examining FTX’s balance sheet before making a final decision.\n\n\nNov 9, 2022\nAfter conducting due diligence on FTX’s balance sheet, Binance ultimately decides to step out of the deal. As a result, SBF reveals to investors that FTX will file for bankruptcy.\n\n\nNov 10, 2022\nThe Bahamas securities’ regulator freezes the digital assets of the Bahamas subsidiary of FTX.\n\n\nNov 11, 2022: FTX Bankruptcy\nSBF steps down as CEO and FTX files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.\n\n\nNov 18, 2022\nThe Securities Commission of The Bahamas (SCB) takes control of crypto assets within FTX. SBF is instructed to move the assets to the regulator’s wallet in order to protect creditors.\n\n\nDec 12, 2022\nFTX founder SBF is arrested by Bahamian authorities and later extradited to the U.S., where he’s indicted by the U.S. District Court in Manhattan and charged on eight counts, including securities fraud and money laundering.\n\n\nDec 22, 2022\nSBF is released on a $250 million bond, the largest in history, by a federal judge.\n\n\nCurrent State of Affairs\nAs of this point, both FTX customers and creditors have yet to withdraw their assets from FTX. This is where it gets interesting: amidst the ongoing lawsuit, there have been plans for a reboot known as FTX 2.0. Let’s take a look at them.\n\n\n\nFTX 2.0\nIt appears that since January 2023, John Ray, the new FTX CEO who took over the exchange prior to bankruptcy proceedings, has set up a task force to work on restarting FTX, launching FTX 2.0. This comes after an announcement on Jan 11, 2023, highlighting that FTX has recovered at least $5 billion of liquid assets, of which more than $3 billion is owed to its top 50 creditors. On May 22, 2023, it was revealed that documents had recently been filed in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware that depict the extensive planning put in by Ray and his team to execute the launch of FTX 2.0.\nTwitter: John Ray III confirms FTX 2.0 Plans\nRay shared that some of FTX’s shareholders have given feedback that, should FTX be relaunched, it could still be a viable business, and it may be possible to reimburse users with their assets. In addition, creditors will also be able to benefit by recouping the loans they’ve made, a point raised by Twitter influencer @loomdart.\nHowever, there have been some doubts regarding the validity of FTX 2.0, with concerns including FTX’s technical deficiencies, which resulted in high latency and software bugs that undermine the user experience. Nonetheless, Ray has attempted to address these concerns, enlisting cybersecurity firm Sygnia to enhance the security of FTX. On the legal side of things, Ray has also been keeping in touch with investment bank Perella Weinberg Partners L.P. to review steps required for the rebooting of FTX.\nRestarting FTX to launch FTX 2.0 is likely going to require a very large sum of fresh capital. In the latest court filing, it was revealed that Ray had reviewed a list of bidders for FTX 2.0 amongst rumors that Tribe Capital, a VC firm that invested in FTX before its collapse, has expressed interest in leading the round for FTX 2.0.\nIt seems we might be closer to the launch of FTX 2.0 than we think.\n\nThe Bottom Line\nWhat will FTX 2.0 mean for the market? Users may be able to gain access to their assets, which has been inaccessible since November 2022, and creditors could also retrieve their loans. Nonetheless, whether users will be able to trust the exchange once it’s been set up is still an unknown, since its tarnished reputation might deter users from using it. In the meantime, it might be interesting to keep tabs on FTT’s price, which is likely to be volatile in light of news revolving around FTX 2.0.\nUnited States District Court Southern District of New York: United States of America v.

    "text": "Notes\nHyperbolic is a microservices platform, that attempts to acheieve a practical optimum between decentralization (censorhip-resistance) and performance (throughput, bandwidth).\nGoal: combine the best of blockchain and cloud computing\n\nContext and Motivation\n\nweb3 attempts to host the computation of all services on a decentralized platform backed by a ledger (blockchain)\nencoding each step of computation as a transaction is impractical\ncloud compute suffers from isolation, trust assumptions, and lack of interoperability\ncloud compute services vary in performance demand and fault tolerance, so naively applying blockchains is inefficient\nL2s and current blockchain innovations again introduce isolation between services\n\n\n\nOverview\n\nHyperbolic facilitates development and deployment of composable Decentralized Services (D-Services) that follow a new Invoke-Return-Combine (IRC) paradigm.\nD-services are hosted by a dynamic subset of nodes, which make tradeoffs between performance and fault tolerance, and follow a classic client-server model with server side fault tolerance.\nTo help developers build their D-Services, Hyperbolic will provide useful, basic D-services such as\n\nContent delivery network (CDN)\nVideo streaming (D-streaming)\nPublish-subscribe patterns (D-PubSub)\nBlockchain ledger (D-Ledger)\n\nAll services follow IRC model, and will allow an ecosystem of reusable modules.\n\nHyllo\nHyperbolic’s first-party messaging app: non-custodial, bound to cryptographic identities. Hyllo will serve as a portal to Hyperbolic, allowing end-users to seamlessly interact with D-Services.\n\n\nBolic: Self-Healing Network Fabric\nBolic is an internet scale subsystem that delivers arbitrary binary data from one crypto entity to another, designed with modularity from the ground up and with careful thoughts of abstraction. There is a necessary dissagregation of the following three aspects:\n\nNoiton of data transmission from one party to another should be as simple as an airdrop. Tag (encrypt) the message with recipient’s id and “drop” is to Bolic.\nThe actual transport, which could be backed by TCP/UDP/Websocket/SMS/emails, does not need to know the content of the data because it’s E2E encrypted.\nThe routing mechanism to balance resource cost, reliability, and performance, offering different tradeoffs and plans.\n\nBolic represents the web in web3, building on top of the existing internet - but there could also be other data carriers such as Tor-style privacy channels.\n\n\nP2P v. Cient-Server\nClient-server is seen in more centralized systems where servers have more authority oevr user’s data dn computation. However, it still has advantages over pure P2P (lower cost bandwidth).\nImagine a lareg, 100k-person, groupchat.\n\nClient-Server: Everyone talks to server, which sends only one message to each user.\nP2P: gossip protocol where each user sends to every other, massive duplication.\nMiddle-Ground: Group chat has 100 chat servers, where each of the 100k users talks to 60 servers at a time. 100 peers in network, high resistance to failure. Every user guaranteed to share &gt;= 20 servers with another user.\n\nThis resembled quorum intersections in consensus protocols that power PoS blockchains, but sending messages is easier than consensus. Overall effect: cost shrunk 1000x from 100k nodes to 100.\n\n\nD-Services\nAll connected participants in Hyperbolic are nodes. Most nodes will have their relay ability enabled, running Bolic which forwards encrypted data. In addition to relay, nodes can opt into one or more server roles of D-Services.\nServices are rendered by RPC-style invocations of methods offered by the service, whose responses get aggregated and deduplicated locally at each client.\nnotation\n\n\\(S\\): D-service\n\\(N_S\\): Nodes of service\n\\(i\\): Arbitrary client\n\\(Q_{Si} \\Subset N_S\\): Service-prescribed subset of servers\n\nThe Invoke-Return-Combine trip is as follows:\nInvoke: Each client \\(i \\in N_c\\) initiates an RPC call by signing a message \\(S.Invoke(i, method, nonce, input)\\) and sends it to all nodes in \\(Q_{Si}\\), where \\(nonce\\) is a per-invocation identifier to distinguish calls.\nReturn: Each server \\(u\\), upon receiving RPC call message, validates the message and returns its response by signing and sending \\(S.Return(i, method, nonce, input-hash, u, output_u)\\) back to client \\(i\\).\nCombine: Each client \\(i\\), upon receiving at least a threshold (constant \\(T_{Si} \\leq \\|Q_{Si}\\) predefined by the service for each client) of responses from servers:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nR_i = \\{ output_u : S.Return(i,method,none,input-hash,u,output_u), u \\in Q_{Si}\\}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] where \\(\\|R_i\\| \\geq T_{Si}\\).\nIt computes the final output locally by a service-prescribed client part of D-Service logic: \\(output_i = S.Combine(R_i)\\). The D-service designer must ensure that as long as the number of collected responses \\(\\|R_i\\|\\) is not les than the threshold, the combined output is deterministic and consistent regardless of the number of responses.\nThe groupchat example can use \\(T_{Si} = 51, \\forall i \\in N_c\\) threshold and run \\(\\|N_S\\| = 100\\) servers.\nThis guarantees if at least 51×2−100 = 2 out of 20 servers to which any two clients connect render the service, the message could be passed over directly. Even if there is no non-faulty server in common between any two clients, the clients can still rely on each one of the 60 servers to transmit the message through the Bolic P2P network.\nD-Service paradigm offers the flexibility to engage “quorum-style” fault tolerance as in Proof-of-Stake consensus protocols, and also naturally fits the idea of “aggregation-style” of cryptography like threshold signatures.\n\n\nIncentivization Algorithms\nTo encourage active participation, they design a Proof-of-Relay scheme for Bolic network, and a Proof-of-Storage scheme for the D-CDN service.\nIn Proof-of-Relay, it’s impractical to require nodes to generate a proof and redeem a reward for each message. Instead, randomly select nodes as a verifiable starting point to conduct a “verifiable random walk” for connectivity in each epoch. Running the challenge epochs indefinitely provides network-wide coverage and incentivizes the network to stay healthy without stuttering the transmission.\nProof-of-Relay is built on the following components:\n\nblockchain: customized ledger to track epoch-related events and keep a record of rewards\nVRF: protocol allowing multiple parties to collaboratively generate verifiable random output\nrandomness beacon: service that regularly produces pseudo-random seeds for the VRF\nElliptic-Curve Diffie-Hellman: a key exchange protocol that allows two parties, each having an elliptic-curve public-private key pair to establish a shared secret over an insecure channel. It’s a variant of Diffie-Hellman using EC cryptography."

Streaming from multiple regions is supported.\nShredstream provides the lowest latency shreds to any RPC or validator on the network. It can save hundreds of milliseconds when trading on Solana and provides a redundant shred path for servers in remote locations.\nShreds are fractions of blocks that are made by a block producer on Solana. One can compare shreds to the individual picture frames in a video stream. Other nodes on the network receive these shreds and replay them on-the-fly, meaning state is always changing on Solana vs. Ethereum where state is paused intra-slot.\nShreds are distributed to the nwtork in a tree-like manner. The number of hops a shred takes to reach a server is related to a stake-weighted shuffle; servers with high stake are likely to be 0 or 1 hops away whil RPC servers are likely to be 1 or 2 hops.\n\nRunning ShredStream\n\nDocs\n\n\n\n\nMempoolStream\nSolana has a unique architecture because there’s no mempool! Transactions are sent directly to leaders in what’s called Gulf Stream. Between this and the streaming nature of Solana, the mempool looks more like a river than a pool.\nJito’s unique architecture allows searchers to receive a stream of pending transactions called a mempool stream so they can inspect and bundle them to be executed sequentially and atomically on the validator.\nJito Validators connect to a relayer and tells the network through gossip to send transactions to the relayer instead of directly to the validator. The relayer will filter and deduplicate transactions before immediately forwarding them to Jito’s Block Engine. the block engine will then send transactions to searchers where searchers can bundle the trades and submit them to the block engine to be included in the current block.\nThe Relayer holds transactions for at most 200ms before forwarding them to the validator. This means searchers have at most 200ms to construct bundles before the packets beat them to the validator.\nThe 200ms delay maximizes the fairness for searchers to contruct bundles, doesn’t impact the validator’s block packing ability, doesn’t impact Solana’s UX, and allows for efficient MEV.\nThe mempool can be accessed through the block engine. After getting access to the block engine, one can run searcher_client in the searcher-examples repository to inspect the mempool. Please look at the README.md in the repository for the most up-to-date instructions on listening to the mempool."

Bridgewater and Barry was at DE Shaw\nbeen in crypto 2016\ncofounded nft marketplace that minted tweets as NFTs (dorsey tweet)\n2021 grouped together, looked at doing mevGeth for Cosmos client. Went to Terra hackerhouse and thats where Terra collapsed.\nBuilt full fledge builder, launched on Juno, Evmos, Osmosis, Injective, Neutron, Terra2\nRaised 6.5mm seed 15 (50) Series A, Bain Cap\nthere wasnt enough MEV to sustain in the bear market, decided to shift to value add rather than extract. - routing system (IBC)\nit was difficult to learn how to use it in a cross chain environment bc of wrapping and routing and such.\nunwinds can be many chains long, all require separate txs. Swapping along the way makes it even harder.\nFIRSt PRODUCT\nbuilt SKIP api which allows any chain to chain in a single tx.\nThey do a significant amunt of IBC volume billion/mo\nintegrated in core frontends. Osmosis, keplr, leap, sources of orderflow\neventually will turn on fees.\nSECOND PRODUCT\noracle slinky fast, high security oracle primarily for perpetual protocols. Built with dydx, they will use it as enshrined oracle. Enshrined for berachain too, will be for injective\ndid BD frontloaded, have to deliver on\nits functionally a restaking product. Taking the stake used to secure each network, using it to secure the oracle.\nno one is actually doing anything with restaking.\nBuilt the sidecar of the restaking system, modular way such that they can add functionality: run sequencers, run lightclients, run bridge clients.\nOwn substantial portions of token supply with osmosis, celestia,\nOverall: luxery infrastructure provider, dev tooling\nTEAM 18 people, porbably going up to 25\nhavent touched raise, made a ton of money from ecosystem\n4-8mm burn at 5 now\nWant to raise a series B, probably the last raise, not sure when: maybe late 2024 early 2025.\nProb dont have to raise, but to scale up and launch token and build ecosystem might make sense\nFirst val 30mm Last valuation was 80mm\nCapture 20% of mev on osmosis, voted in by validators bc they had them in on fundraising\nprotorev\ngauntlets strategic thing is getting in early w governance and gets huge contracts that wouldnt be accepted otherwise\nhave almost everything staked or liquid staked, sell those tokens which does a significant amount of runway coverage\nreally over exposed to celestia and osmosis, will likely rebalance into other tokens. Expect to have consistnet token denominated revnue in the other chains, so may just sell into cash\nhttps://pinewolytics.de/osmosis/protorev\nhttps://skip.money/products\nFinal product in the MEV space is the block SDK. Maintain the software, dont expect a large payout from block SDK. Kinda like an enshrined Cosmos chain.\nVertical exposure.\nOracle good: OEV.\nSkip API good for orderflow.\nAcheive immortality: have enough cash denominarted revenue to maintain themselves.\nSTAKEHOLDERS\nAPI: end/retail users, sometimes dont know they using (sometimes do ibc.fun). Keplr/osmosis (wallets have mroe pricing paower), DEXes - anychain swaps. Where they choose to do DEX volume matters. launched cctp support, and axelar.\nOracle: validator set, people running sidecar processes. Second is protocol itself, decides to give onchain support, partner there. Relationship w dydx very good.\noffice in soho"

    "text": "Running a Node on Testnet\nUPDATE: Goerli halted\n\nGoerli stopped producing blocks on March 13\nThe chain is halted, gETH has been rugged\n\nEigenLayer Comms (from discord)\nUSER @maciver\n\nVery disappointing how the Goerli testnet has been managed, horrible communication & treatment by the team towards operators/developers.\nAlot of us were very exicted about EigenLayer and rightfully so as it is huge for the Ether ecosystem. We powered up our nodes, deployed capital, updated it frequently, engaged with the community, solved problems... \n\nThen we just get kicked to the curb and told \"yeah we are starting again\" \n\nHow do you expect operators/developers to re engage another testnet and help out again after getting treated so poorly lmao\nAnyways, don't want to moan, its time to move on. But i hope the team see's these complaints and addresses them.\n________________________________________________________________________________________\nTEAM @Alex | I will never DM you first\n\nHey @maciver,\nWe do understand what you are saying regarding the Stage 2 testnet on Goerli. We are grateful for their participation; it has been both appreciated and permanently recorded on the blockchain. The history of your involvement will remain intact. Our team is transitioning to a functional testnet because Goerli is no longer viable for our needs. Thank you very much once again.\n________________________________________________________________________________________\nUSER @maciver\n\nAre you able to give more details, on \"The history of your involvement will remain intact\", are we getting 'rewarded/compensated' for our involvement in Stage 2?\n\nI want to opt back in for Holesky, because i like this project and community. But am hesitant given what has happened. I spent alot of hours on stage 2 testnet both in the community helping and running my node. I'm sure you understand that having to set it all back up again without any details on the outcome of our involvement in stage 2 is hard, espically given how it has ended.\nAgain, i hate typing these messages, i sound like a b itch. But i just feel many others feel the same as me. So its imortant to address this\n________________________________________________________________________________________\nTEAM @Alex | I will never DM you first\n\nSorry, I have no details about the rewards. Our testnet isn't incentivized. Our team is currently working on migrating on Holesky, so I will be able to share more info as soon as they are available.\n________________________________________________________________________________________\nUSER @0xhiro\n\nOne thought is that perhaps EigenLayer could set up a faucet on Holesky and those who accumulated points on Goerli could redeem them for Holesky ETH. This would help offset some of the losses for those who bought significant amounts of goETH to participate in EigenDA operating on Goerli\n________________________________________________________________________________________\nMOD @Dagger\n\nSorry to read that, but the decision to stop Goerli wasn't from the EigenLayer team, it was made by Ethereum's community.\n________________________________________________________________________________________\nUSER @Fuzzyman410\n\n@Dagger @Alex | I will never DM you first @Brianna I was top 200, but unstaked yesterday when we were told we were allowed to, and now I obviously can't withdraw any and 32k geth (+7k geth on another account) is stuck, you can see I am still part of EigenDA, will I still be included in top 200 once we migrate to holesky?\n________________________________________________________________________________________\nMOD @Dagger\n\nFor now, the stance is that Holesky will restart again from zero. We'll see if there's any change to that once we approach launch.\nRelated:\nArbitrum announces, on March 11, depreciating Arbitrum Goerli on March 18\n\nOperators\n\nbmac\nQuant Drip\nHappy Feet\nNitro Operations\nLayerZero Intern\nOperation6\nMove Apprentice\nBrvo\nSerShokunin\nMacro Takes\npumpy\nchef\nfederal reserve\nanon mf\nlycurgus\n\n\n\nResources\n\nRelease 0.3.0\nUpgrade Node Docs\nCLI v6 Release\nGoerli Dashboard\n\n\n\nSetup\nCreate EC2 Instance\n\nCreate AWS Instance\nCopy IPv4 DNS\nAdd ssh alias command to zshrc\n\nnano ~/.zshrc\nsource ~/.zshrc\n\n\nInstall Docker\n# Add Docker's official GPG key:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl gnupg\nsudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings\ncurl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg\nsudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg\n\n# Add the repository to Apt sources:\necho \\\n  \"deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \\\n  $(. /etc/os-release && echo \"$VERSION_CODENAME\") stable\" | \\\n  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list &gt; /dev/null\nsudo apt-get update\n\n# Install latest docker version\nsudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin\n\n# verify successful installation with \nsudo docker run hello-world\nInstall Eigen\n# install Eigen CLI using binary\ncurl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/layr-labs/eigenlayer-cli/master/scripts/install.sh | sh -s\n\n# add to PATH\nexport PATH=$PATH:~/bin\n\n\nSetup\nCreate Keys\n# create Keys \neigenlayer operator keys create --key-type ecdsa opr\neigenlayer operator keys create --key-type bls opr\nSave these private keys somewhere safe, upload ecdsa pk into metamask and fund it with ETH\nCreate config\neigenlayer operator config create\n\nPopulate? yes\nOperator Address: paste ecdsa pub\nRPC: https://ethereum-goerli.publicnode.com\nECDSA key path: /home/ubuntu/.eigenlayer/operator_keys/opr.ecdsa.key.json\nBLS key path: /home/ubuntu/.eigenlayer/operator_keys/opr.bls.key.json\nNetwork: Goerli\n\nEdit Config\n\nCreate github repo\nupload pfp.png to repo\n\nnano metadata.json\n{\n  \"name\": \"TODO name\",\n  \"website\": \"website\",\n  \"description\": \"pow pow\",\n  \"logo\": \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/USER/REPO/main/pfp.png\",\n  \"twitter\": \"https://twitter.com/user\"\n}\n\nPaste this in a github repo.\n\nnano operator.yaml\nGet raw url to the metadata.json, paste as “metadata_url”"

A peer will preferentially upload to the peers that provide it the best download speeds. This encourages peers to contribute upload bandwidth in order to receive faster downloads in return.[1][6]\nEach peer will “unchoke” (allow uploading to) a limited number of other peers at a time, typically 4. It will unchoke the 3 peers providing it the fastest download speeds, plus 1 randomly chosen peer. This is called “optimistic unchoking” and allows discovering new potentially better partners.[2][4][8]\nIf a peer is choked by all peers it is downloading from, it will stop uploading to those peers. This “anti-snubbing” measure is intended to discourage free-riding.[2][6]\nChoking and unchoking is done periodically, typically every 10 seconds, to adapt to changing network conditions and peer behavior.[8]\nBy basing upload decisions on download speeds from each peer, BitTorrent implements a tit-for-tat reciprocity that rewards cooperation. Peers that contribute more upload bandwidth will in turn receive faster downloads.[1][6]\n\nIn summary, the tit-for-tat mechanism enables BitTorrent to achieve robust cooperation and discourage free-riding in a decentralized system. Peers have individual incentives to provide upload bandwidth to others in order to receive reciprocal uploads and faster downloads for themselves. The optimistic unchoking allows the system to continually discover better peer connections.\nCitations: [1] https://computer.howstuffworks.com/bittorrent2.htm [2] http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs5412/2012sp/slides/VI%20-%20Torrents%20and%20Tit%20for%20Tat.pdf [3] https://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-software-2/how-does-bittorrent-tit-for-tat-work-812421/ [4] https://www.researchgate.net/figure/a-Tit-for-tat-mechanism-b-Optimistic-unchoking-c-Anti-snubbing-black-line_fig2_258247974 [5] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWOPD8BgHtc [6] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tit_for_tat [7] https://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Giovanni.Neglia/publications/neglia07netcoop.pdf [8] https://mislove.org/teaching/cs4700/spring11/lectures/lecture20.pdf"

They have the following key properties:\n\nHiding: The commitment does not reveal any information about the committed value to the verifier. Pedersen commitments are perfectly hiding, meaning even an unbounded adversary cannot determine the committed value from the commitment.\nBinding: The committer cannot open the commitment to a different value than the one they committed to. Pedersen commitments are computationally binding, meaning a polynomial-time adversary cannot find two different values that open to the same commitment, assuming the discrete logarithm problem is hard.\nHomomorphic: Pedersen commitments are additively homomorphic. Given commitments \\(C(m_1, r_1)\\) and \\(C(m_2, r_2)\\), one can compute \\(C(m_1 + m_2, r_1 + r_2)\\) without knowing the individual committed values[1][2].\n\nHere’s how Pedersen commitments work[1][3][5]:\n\nSetup: Choose a cyclic group \\(G\\) of prime order \\(p\\) where the discrete log problem is hard. Pick two random generators \\(g\\) and \\(h\\) such that the discrete log of \\(h\\) with respect to \\(g\\) is unknown.\nCommit: To commit to a message \\(m \\in \\mathbb{Z}_p\\), the committer picks a random \\(r \\in \\mathbb{Z}_p\\) and computes the commitment \\(C = g^m h^r\\).\nOpen: To open the commitment, the committer reveals \\(m\\) and \\(r\\). The verifier checks that \\(C = g^m h^r\\).\n\nPedersen commitments are widely used in cryptographic protocols like zero-knowledge proofs, confidential transactions, and verifiable secret sharing. For example, they are used in Monero to hide transaction amounts while allowing validation that no new money was created[7].\nSome advantages of Pedersen commitments are perfect hiding, homomorphic properties, and short commitment size. Limitations include the need for a trusted setup and the binding property being only computational rather than perfect.\nResources\n\nNon-Interactive and Information-Theoretic Secure Verifiable Secret Sharing Here are the citations reformatted as titled markdown links:\nWhat is a Pedersen Commitment? - Cryptography Stack Exchange\nCommitment scheme - Wikipedia\nPedersen Commitment with Elliptic Curves - Findora\nPedersen Commitments - Computerphile - YouTube\nPedersen Commitment - A Security Site\nOn the use of Pedersen Commitments for Confidential Payments - NCC Group\nPedersen Commitment - Monero"

They fall under the category of homomorphic hiding and binding commitments.\nKey properties of KZG commitments:\n\nConstant size: The commitment to a polynomial is a single group element on an elliptic curve, regardless of the polynomial’s degree. This makes the commitment very compact compared to other schemes like Merkle trees.\nHomomorphic: KZG commitments allow for homomorphic operations on the committed polynomials. You can add commitments to get a commitment to the sum of the polynomials.\nHiding: KZG commitments are computationally hiding under the discrete logarithm assumption. An infinite number of polynomials map to the same commitment value.\nBinding: They are computationally binding, meaning a committer cannot open a commitment to two different polynomials unless they can solve the discrete logarithm problem.\nPartial opening: KZG allows for efficient proofs of evaluation at specific points without revealing the entire polynomial. The proof size is constant (a single group element) regardless of the number of evaluation points proven.\n\nKZG commitments require a trusted setup to generate the structured reference string (SRS) needed for the scheme. The SRS consists of powers of a secret value in the exponent of a generator of an elliptic curve group.\nKZG commitments are widely used in zero-knowledge proof systems like PLONK and SONIC, and also in polynomial IOP-based proof systems. They will be used in Ethereum for polynomial commitments in data availability sampling and proofs[1][2].\nIn summary, KZG is a powerful polynomial commitment scheme with homomorphic properties, constant-sized commitments and evaluation proofs, making it very efficient and versatile for many cryptographic applications.\nResources\n\n(Original Paper) Constant-Size Commitments to Polynomials and Their Applications\nKZG in Practice: Polynomial Commitment Schemes and Their Usage in Scaling Ethereum\nDankrad Feist: KZG Polynomial Commitments\nConstant-Size Commitments to Polynomials and Their Applications\nKate Polynomial Commitments\n\nKZG Commitment - Inevitable\nKZG polynomial commitments: trusted setup DKG\nKZG Polynomial Commitments\nExtractable Witness Encryption for KZG Cotmmitments and Efficient Laconic OT"

    "text": "Example: The 3-Color Graph Coloring Problem\nA Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) allows a prover to demonstrate knowledge of some secret without revealing the secret itself. Let’s illustrate this using a graph coloring problem.\n\nProblem Statement\nImagine Alice has a graph \\((G = (V, E))\\), where \\((V)\\) is the set of vertices and \\((E)\\) is the set of edges. Alice claims she can 3-color the graph so that no adjacent vertices share the same color. Bob wants to verify this claim without learning the actual coloring.\n\n\nThe ZKP Protocol\n\nCommitment: Alice chooses a random permutation of her 3-coloring and commits to it, sending a cryptographic hash of each vertex’s color to Bob.\nChallenge: Bob randomly selects an edge \\(((u, v) \\in E)\\)\nResponse: Alice reveals the colors of vertices \\((u)\\) and \\((v)\\).\nVerification: Bob checks if the revealed colors are different and match the hash commitments.\n\nThrough repeated iterations, Bob becomes increasingly confident that Alice has a valid 3-coloring, but gains no knowledge about the coloring itself.\n\n\nMath Syntax\n\nGraph: \\((G = (V, E))\\)\nColors: \\((\\{ \\text{Red}, \\text{Green}, \\text{Blue} \\})\\)\nRandom Permutation: \\((\\pi)\\)\nHash Commitment for vertex \\((v): ( H(\\pi(\\text{color}(v))) )\\)\n\nThis example shows that ZKPs can provide robust verification without sacrificing the secrecy of the information involved.\n\n\nConclusion\nGraph three coloring is NP-complete. Thus, any protocol that can prove a solution to this problem can be used to prove any statement in the class NP.\nThree critical properties a ZKP must satisfy:\n\nCompleteness: If the Prover is honest, then she will eventually convince the Verifier.\nSoundness: The Prover can only convince the Verifier if the statement is true.\nZero-knowledge(ness): The Verifier learns no information beyond the fact that the statement is true."

    "text": "The Schnorr Identification Protocol\nThe Schnorr protocol, invented by Claus-Peter Schnorr in the 1980s, was concerned with identification.\nImagine that Alice has published her public key to the world, and later on wants to prove that she knows the secret key corresponding to that public key. This is the exact problem that we encounter in real-world protocols such as public-key SSH, so it turns out to be well-motivated.\nSchnorr began with the assumption that the public key would be of a very specific format.\nSpecifically, let \\(p\\) be some prime number, and let \\(g\\) be a generator of a cyclic group of prime-order \\(q\\). To generate a keypair, Alice would first pick a random integer \\(a\\) between 1 and \\(q\\), and then compute the keypair as:\n\\[PK_A = g^a \\: mod \\: p, \\; SK_A = a\\]\nLater on, she wants to prove knowledge of her secret key, she conducts the following interaction with Bob.\n\nAlice: Pick a random \\(k\\) in range \\(1, \\, ... \\, , \\, q\\) and send Bob \\(h = g^k \\: mod \\: p\\)\nBob: Pick a random \\(c\\) in range \\(1, \\, ... \\, , \\, q\\) and send Alice \\(c\\)\nAlice: Send Bob \\(s = ac + k \\: mod \\: q\\)\nBob: Check that \\(g^s = PK^c_A \\dot h \\: mode \\: p\\)\n\n\nIs this complete?\nYes, just by looking at the math and performing substitution.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\ng^s & \\equiv P K_A^c \\cdot h & & \\bmod p \\\\\ng^{a c+k} & \\equiv\\left(g^a\\right)^c \\cdot g^k & & \\bmod p \\\\\ng^{a c+k} & \\equiv g^{a c+k} & & \\bmod p\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\nIs it sound?\nWe demonstrate soundness with a special algorithm called a knowledge extractor. A knowledge extractor (or just ‘Extractor’ for short) is a special type of Verifier that interacts with a Prover, and — if the Prover succeeds in completing the proof — the Extractor should be able to extract the Prover’s original secret.\nTo prove soundness for a proof of knowledge, we must show that an Extractor exists for every possible Prover.\nThe extractor for the Schnorr protocol is very simple: After step 3 is complete, rewind the interaction back to step 2. This tricks Alice into performing step 3 with two different \\(c\\) values (\\(c1\\) and \\(c2\\)) using the same \\(k\\).\nThe extractor can then solve the following equation to recover Alice’s secret:\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{rr}\n\\left(s_1-s_2\\right) /(c 1-c 2) & \\bmod q \\\\\n=\\left(a c_1+k\\right)-\\left(a c_2+k\\right) /(c 1-c 2) & \\bmod q \\\\\n=a(c 1-c 2) /(c 1-c 2) & \\bmod q \\\\\n& =a\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n\nIs it zero-knowledge?\nWe can prove zero-knowledgeness by describing a Simulator that can interact with any possible Verifier and produce a ‘simulated’ transcript of the proof, even if the Simulator doesn’t know the secret it’s proving it knows.\nThe Schnorr protocol does not have such a Simulator. to make the proof work, we need to make an assumption:\nthe Verifier needs to be “honest”, meaning it will pick its challenge “c” using only its random number generator, and will not choose this value based on any input we provide it.\nThe Simulator does the following:\n\nOutput some initial \\(g^{k_1}\\) as the Prover’s first message, and find out what the Verifier chooses.\nRewind the Verifier, and pick a random integer \\(z\\) in the range \\(1, \\, ... \\, , \\, q - 1\\)\nCompute \\(g^{k_2} = g^z \\times g^{a(-c)}\\) and output \\(g^{k_2}\\) as the Prover’s new initial message.\nWhen the verifier challenges on \\(c\\) again, output \\(z\\).\n\nThis proves the protocol must be zero-knowledge against an honest Verifier.\n\n\nMaking it non-interactive\nWhat if Bob is not online?\nTurns out you can use a sufficient hash function to generate the challenge.\n\nProver picks \\(g^k\\) just as in the interactive protocol.\nProver computes the challenge as \\(c = H(g^k \\, || \\, M)\\) where \\(H()\\) is a hash function, and \\(M\\) is an optional and arbitrary message string.\nCompute \\(s = ac + k \\: mod \\: q\\) just as in the interactive protocol.\n\nThis non-interactive proof is not just a proof of knowledge, but it’s also a signature scheme. That is, if you put a message into the (optional) value \\(M\\), you obtain a signature on \\(M\\), which can only be produced by someone who knows the secret key \\(a\\). The resulting protocol is called the Schnorr signature scheme, and it’s the basis of real-world protocols like EdDSA."

How much would you have to get paid to park your funds at Binance? 30%? 80%? This is a real question that CEX HFT shops and crypto VCs decide internally - the consensus is almost certainly above $USDe’s expected yield.\nThe only proper mitigation I see is to avoid custodying assets at the exchanges. Park the stETH in Fireblocks, Ledger, etc. and make special agreements with Binance, Bybit, Bitmex, etc. to accept this (likely some form of ZK-Proof of stETH asset claim) as collateral, and simply settle funding payments intermittently.\nThis doesn’t exactly eliminate all counterparty risk (still an operational nightmare/panic if Binance goes FTX mode), but it ensures assets are safu. I’m not sure this is actually Ethena’s plan, but it appears to be the only sufficient solution (assuming CEXs agree to the setup).\nTODO: Mention the black swan force exit short perps too (the BitMex event)? - Ethena redemption should have scaled down exposure in the hours and minutes prior to this event (funding will necessarily have been negative before the trigger) - Ethena is hedged across multiple CEXes (historically this happens on one exchange at a time) - Ethena insurance fund as final backstop\n6/ Addressing Basis Risk\nThe question/issue is what happens when (not if) the perp-spot spread flips, and the delta-neutral position begins to bleed (rather than accrue) funding payments.\n@leptokurtic gives the TLDR mitigation/assumptions here\nhttps://twitter.com/leptokurtic_/status/1682781081068769280?s=20\n7/ I will focus on one of Ethena’s core assumptions, specifically that the “natural funding rate” is positive. Imo, this is where an interesting discussion lies.\nTo be clear, this assumption is not baseless - it is both supported by historical ETH perp data, and is generally true across (almost) all derivative markets.\n\n\n\n8/ However, I subscribe to two schools of thought which may challenge this assumption.\n\nQuantum Mechanics (the observer effect): The act of observing or measuring a system necessarily disturbs or changes the system.\nSoros’s Reflexivity of Markets: Market participants’ imperfect understanding of the world influences their actions, and those actions, in turn, influence the world in ways that can confirm or contradict their initial beliefs.\n\nKeeping in mind the scale of the stablecoin market, it’s naive to neglect the reflexivity bwteen Ethena’s operations and the ETH perp funding rate. The backtested yield in the previous tweet is under the assumption of $5b circulating $USDe supply - I predict this in-sample backtesting wil. This implies a $5b short OI, which is sustantial considering aggregate OI seen historically.\nThe image below shows Binance alone, but including Bybit, Bitmex, Derbit, and OKEx, total OI on ETH perpetual swaps is ~$TODO. Ethena would represent TODO% of ETH perp OI across all major exchanges.\n\n\n\nFix Up - not final\n9/ The question becomes: In the scenario wherein $USDe is widely adopted, what is the “natural funding rate” of ETH perps? Here’s a thesis:\nThe introduction of ETH staking, and liquid staking derivatives, effectively increased the baseline ETH lending rate (ETH’s LIBOR/SOFR) by the network’s staking yield. Why would anyone lend ETH at 80bps, when they can deposit for an LSD and earn 5% (where they can also then lend the LSD for 80bps)?\nThe “natural funding rate” baseline (not including the upwards skew cause by net bullish payment for leverage, which will remain a factor) on ETH perps will no longer necessarily == risk-free rate, as traditionally assumed for non-interest accruing assets (BTC, Gold, etc.). Instead, it will begin to additionally reflect the yield of ETH staking (risk-free rate - expected stETH yield). {{\n\n\n\n}}\n10/ Explain the logic - how other traders will arb funding rate considering availability of stETH as collateral. Why would this suggest a negative bias ~= eth yield.\nFin/ The team behind Ethena is legit. To their credit, it seems they are continuing to diligence this concern. This is a pivotal mechanism for the crypto economy, and I look forward to the exploration that is to come. https://twitter.com/leptokurtic_/status/1682781205811589120?s=20\nTODO: Mention the black swan force exit short perps too (the BitMex event)? - Ethena redemption should have scaled down exposure in the hours and minutes prior to this event (funding will necessarily have been negative before the trigger) - Ethena is hedged across multiple CEXes (historically this happens on one exchange at a time) - Ethena insurance fund as final backstop"

    "text": "Whitepaper\n\nAbstract\nAs with other commodities, markets could help us efficiently produce machine intelligence. We propose a market where intelligence is priced by other intelligence systems peer-to-peer across the internet. Peers rank each other by training neural networks which learn the value of their neighbors. Scores accumulate on a digital ledger where high ranking peers are monetarily rewarded with additional weight in the network. However, this form of peer-ranking is not resistant to collusion, which could disrupt the accuracy of the mechanism. The solution is an incentive mechanism that maximally rewards honestly selected weights, making the system resistant to collusion of up to 50 percent of the network weight. The result is a collectively run intelligence market that continually produces newly trained models and pays contributors who create information theoretic value.\n\n\nMotivation\nWithout markets, AI is overly specialized. Machine intelligence is a commodity, and treating it as such will encourage more generalized objective performance. The proliferation of diverse intelligence models is limited by the need to train large monolithic models to succeed in winner-take-all situations. Standalone engineers cannot directly monetize their work and what results is centralization where a small set of large corporations control access to the best artificial intelligence.\n\n\nModel\nAbstract definition of intelligence: Parameterized function \\(y = f(x)\\) trained over dataset \\(D = [X, Y]\\) to minimize a loss of \\(\\Lambda = E_D[Q(y, f(x))]\\)\nNetwork is comprised of \\(n\\) functions \\(F = f_1, f_2, \\dots , f_n\\) ‘peers’ where each is holding network ‘stake’ \\(S = [s_i]\\). These functions, together with losses and their proportion of stake, represent a stake-weighted machine learning objective \\(\\sum^n_i L_i \\times s_i\\)\nGoal is the distribution of stake I, as an incentive, to peers who have helped minimize the loss-objective, while making it difficult for small stake to collude for network distribution without contributing to loss minimization.\n\\[S_{t+1} = s_{t} + \\tau I\\]\nThey suggest this can be acheived through peer-ranking, where peers use the outputs of others \\(F(x) = [f_0(x) \\dots f_n(x)]\\) as inputs to themselves \\(f(F(x))\\) and learn a set of weights \\(W = [w_i, j]\\) where peer i is responsible for setting the i th row through transactions on a digital ledger.\nWeights are set using a fishers information pruning score (LeCun 1989, Yu 2017) in the ranking calculation, \\(R = W^T \\dot S\\). This idealized scoring such that each peer’s incentive is equivalent to its pruning score: the cost of entropy towards \\(\\sum^n_i L_i \\times s_i\\) induced by removing it from the network.\nEQUATION\nThis is not resistant to collusion, however, as peers can vote for themselves and set weights to enhance their own inflation. This attack is trivial since the digital ledger cannot audit the parameters of each model, only inter-model weights \\(W\\).\nThe naive ranking method is extended to evade collusion with an ‘incentive’ function \\(I(W,S)\\) which limits rewards to peers that have not reached consensus in the network. In the absence of a 51% collusion, peers can only attain inflation by working to attract votes from the majority.\nReintroducing our terms, our incentive mechanism requires a stake vector \\(S\\) and a set of weights \\(W\\) where rows are inter-peer rankings. We also infer a trust matrix \\(T\\) from the weights where \\(t_{i,j} = 1\\) if and only if there is a non-zero edge between peer i and j.\nWe defined peers who have reached ‘consensus’ as those with non-zero edges from more than \\(50\\%\\) of stake in the network (normalized \\((T^T \\dot S) &gt; 0.5\\)). The computation is defined as a continuous sigmoid function to ensure the mechanism is differentiable. The sigmoid rewards connected peers and punishes the non-trusted. Steepness and threshold point can be modulated through a tempurature \\(Q\\) and shift term \\(\\kappa\\).\n\\[C = \\sigma (\\rho(T^TS-\\kappa))\\]\nTempurature \\(Q = 10\\) and shift \\(\\kappa = .5\\) takes the trust scores and produces an exponential scaling up to inflection point where peer is connected to majority.\nThis consensus approach protects against naive collusion, but it does not incentivise correctly selecting weights. These incentives are introduced by adapting inflation mechanism with a speculation based reward ‘bonds’ \\(B\\), a matrix of values \\(b_{i,j}\\) which represent the proportion of bonds owned by peer \\(i\\) in peer \\(j\\). Bonds accumulate at each step much like token inflation where \\(\\Delta B = W \\dot S\\). Peers accumulate bonds in the peers they rank, thus ;bonding’ themselves to those they are connected to.\n\\[B_{t+1} = B_t + W \\dot S\\]\nThis mechanism lets peers speculate on the future value accrual of other peers. This is then slightly modified to ensure peers attain a fized proportion of their personal inflation."

    "text": "Making Money on Tao\nEven if we don’t particularly believe in the roadmap of the BitTensor network or think it’s going to lead to positive expected value for most participants, that’s not to say we can’t make money on it today. Let’s review some basic scenarios that would enable this:\n\nWe run a high quality model at low cost that puts us at parity with other miners because they are unlikely to do better for cheaper. If we pick a subnetwork that has a high stake, it’s possible that the rewards we get will outweigh our costs. For example, let’s imagine that we simply do a passthrough to the GPT4Turbo API with our miner and maybe a custom prompt to make it slightly better than the “out of the box” experience. If our model wins against inferior models, and wins against other GPT4 passthroughs, and our per token cost is low, then we could make some money.\nWe run a model arbitrage play that iteratively determines the lowest cost model across many cloud services that still has an acceptable win rate for a given subnetwork. We then run this all day every day until the statistics change, and then we switch accordingly.\nWe could find populator validators and delegate our stake to them. This will get us a proportional \\(78\\%\\) of our proportion of the reward they get issued. As outlined on the delegation docs here\nWe run a validator ourselves, and can get similar results to other validators with low overhead perhaps by coordinating with them. In order to make our validator more prominent and likely to attract stake, we promote it heavily on social media and perhaps even do cross promotions with other members of our collective\nWe farm airdrops from as many hype social media promotions of subnets as we possibly can, as outlined here\nWe provide a subnet that attempts to compensate for some of the core difficulties associated with the network, while quietly favoring our collective. For example, let’s say we build a ‘trust evaluator’ subnet that scores miners and validators independently as a client of each. Stake could be used as a competitive differentiator\nWe run a large number of legitimate validators for six months, accumulating a large amount of stake. Eliminate every other competing validator on the subnet. Profit.\nWe run a large number of legitimate validators or one really big validator for six months, and then change the validator code to run a more “value oriented” algorithm in agreement with a collective of other validators. Same as above, but we favor our own collective’s miners at a rate that makes them the most profitable\nWe create a highly popular subnet that, for example, directly rather than indirectly facilitates gambling of some kind. Lottery tickets are the easiest but least interesting version of this, prediction markets for many different things are already emerging. Since everyone is already gambling anyway, this is highly appealing, and comes with the benefit that if outcomes are unguessable, miner compute requirements are inherently low, and if outcomes are guessable, as a popular validator you can potentially front run the market or the event by getting useful predictions before anyone else does.\nAt the current valuation level which feels stretched, these high alpha implementations feel a more appropriate means to achieve TAO price exposure."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Aditya Baradwaj was an engineer at Alameda Research after graduating from Berkeley and working at Google. He tells stories about his time at FTX.\n\n\nStart from the Beginning\nAs an engineer at Alameda Research, I had my entire life savings stolen from me by my former boss: Sam Bankman-Fried. Now, after months of recuperation from the craziness of the FTX collapse, I’m ready to tell my story.\nLet’s start at the beginning:\nI still remember my first time meeting Sam - it was my first day of work at the office. I had just left my job at Google, and was excited to be working at this small, mysterious crypto trading firm. At the time, there had only been minor press coverage of Sam. Alameda/FTX were far from well-known even within tech circles. Heck, I only knew about the company because a bunch of early employees had also been students at Berkeley, and the news had spread to me through the grapevine.\nThe office itself was nondescript. Situated on the 4th floor of an ordinary-looking office building in downtown Berkeley, it was a place that I had walked by many times during college. The 4th floor tenant’s name on the directory was conspicuously empty, revealing only that they shared the building with names such as “Pacific Lutheran Theological Seminary”. Hardly the neighbors one would expect for a multi-billion-dollar crypto trading firm. When I entered the office SBF was sitting at his desk in the middle of the trading floor, taking a call while playing League, in characteristic fashion. And yes, that was Alameda’s trading floor…\nDespite the fact that on paper, Sam had already transitioned to running FTX full-time, in practice both companies were highly intertwined. Joint offices, social events, and housing arrangements between both companies was the norm. But more on that later. I’m not sure who he was talking to, but I caught fragments of their conversation from Sam’s end:\n\n“Decentralization is the future. The single most valuable thing you can do for yourself is to drop whatever you’re doing and get into crypto”\n\nThis was the first of many contradictions that I would see with Sam. On one hand, he would extoll the virtues of decentralized, permissionless finance to anyone who would listen. But a custodial, KYC’d derivatives exchange isn’t exactly a paragon of decentralization. Inside you there are two wolves, I guess… or something.\nLater that night we ordered Sliver Pizza and chatted over a game of bughouse - another favorite of Sam’s - and he revealed his plan to move the entire company to a tiny island in the Caribbean. I knew nothing about the Bahamas at the time. But as Sam spoke, it became clear that he had done his research.\n\n“Did you know that FTX’s revenue is greater than 10% of the Bahamas’ GDP?”\n\nI didn’t know, but a quick Google search revealed that he probably wasn’t far off. Sam’s vision for FTX, as he went on to explain, extended far beyond just a crypto exchange.\nHe talked about building a vaccine factory in the Bahamas to fix the invisible graveyard caused by slow FDA approvals. He discussed the strategizing that had gone into the political donations made by the FTX execs. He talked about hypothetical future technologies like iterated embryo selection, and the importance of not letting China get the lead in fundamental biotech research. And of course, he talked about malarial bednets and veganism too.\nHearing Sam unveil his vision for the future, it became clear that every action he had taken - Alameda, FTX, the Bahamas, policy proposals - was all part of a grand plan. He didn’t just want to build a company. He wanted to build a machine - a growing sphere of influence that could break past the walls of that little office in Berkeley and wash over the world as a force for good. Not just a company, but a monument to effective altruism.\nAs a starry-eyed new hire, it was hard not to get drawn in by the boldness of Sam’s vision. Many of us had joined the company precisely because we wanted to do good in the world. And here was a billionaire, not yet 30 years old, who was using his fortune to bankroll a radical new vision for the future. Not to mention, with his self-effacing and awkward demeanor, I suppose many of us saw a little bit of ourselves in him as well. Over the next year and a half, my life was transformed in ways I could never have imagined:\nI experienced opulence the likes of which I’d only seen before in movies. Got flown around the world on a regular basis between Berkeley, Hong Kong, and the Bahamas. Brushed elbows with celebrities, sports icons, and political figures.\nYet at the same time, I saw irresponsibility: Careless risk management for a company handling billions of dollars in capital. Technical debt that would make any software engineer shed a tear. Millions lost in wasteful spending, and the hubris that it wouldn’t matter.\nOf course, Sam didn’t end up building a vaccine factory or eradicating malaria. His customers, investors, and employees - the ones who trusted him most - are financially devastated. And the ruins of the half-built FTX headquarters lay strewn across the beaches of Nassau. Sam himself is behind bars at MDC, having violated the terms of his house arrest. Even after all this, it seems he is incapable of following the rules.\nOver the past months, I’ve seen a ton of speculation online about FTX and Alameda. Unfortunately, not all of it has been based in reality.\nWhat were Sam, Caroline, and the others like in person? Was it all just a scam? How was life in the Bahamas? People deserve to know. Unfortunately, the story of my time at FTX/Alameda is too complex to put in a single thread.\n\n\n\nThe Fat Finger\nThe story of how a misplaced decimal point at Alameda Research caused a market crash that echoed around the world.\nThis incident happened just a few weeks after I joined Alameda. I had just gotten a hang of our engineering workflows and was starting to wrap my head around our trading systems.At a high level, Alameda’s trading operated in two modes:\nThe main one was our semi-systematic strategies, where traders set model parameters that control a complex automated trading system. This way, traders aren’t placing actual trades, but rather fine-tuning an algorithm that decides how to execute those trades at high frequency.\nHowever every once in a while, a trader would need to manually execute a trade. Usually this might happen if our automated trading systems were being buggy due to market volatility, or if there was an arbitrage opportunity on a venue where we hadn’t set up automated trading yet.\nOur automated trading systems handled the vast majority of Alameda’s trading. So naturally, we had sanity checks in place to make sure that the orders being sent were reasonable relative to current market prices. Not so for manual trades, which were by nature discretionary.\nThe tricky thing about risk is that it’s usually invisible, right up until it comes around and bites you in the ass. Well, on October 21 2021, an Alameda trader’s finger slipped.\nThe trader was trying to sell a block of BTC in response to news, and sent out the order via our manual trading system. What they missed was the decimal point was off by a few spaces. Rather than selling BTC at the current market price, they sold it for pennies on the dollar.\nThe result was immediate. The price of BTC shot from a high of $65k to as low as $8k on some venues, only to be quickly restored by arbitrageurs. The sudden price movement lit crypto Twitter on fire as traders scrambled to figure out what was going on:\nNews outlets started picking up too. Binance US - which was the epicenter of the flash crash - released a statement claiming that it had been caused by one of their “institutional traders” who had a “bug in their trading algorithm”.\nI guess Caroline had made some phone calls.\nAlameda’s losses on the fat-finger trade were staggering - on the order of tens of millions. But because it had been an honest mistake, there wasn’t much to do except to implement additional sanity checks for manual trades. And that’s what we did.\nThat’s usually how things worked at Alameda - we would wait until something broke, and then rush to fix it. Which is why it took us so long to implement sanity checks that any “traditional” trading firm would have never started trading without.\nAfter that, it was back to business as usual. According to SBF, the utility we gained by moving fast outweighed the occasional costs we paid due to poor risk checks, hacks, and the like. This was SBF’s work philosophy, and it drove the culture he created at Alameda and FTX\nFor almost two years, the BTC flash crash incident has remained a mystery in the minds of the public. Now you know who was responsible, and what was happening behind the scenes."

    "section": "Implications of the Theorem",
    "text": "Implications of the Theorem\n\nMaximum Data Rate: The theorem provides the theoretical maximum data rate at which information can be transmitted over a noisy channel with an arbitrarily low error rate, given the channel bandwidth and signal-to-noise ratio. This rate is known as the channel capacity. [1][2][3][5][7]\nTradeoff between Bandwidth and SNR: The theorem shows that there is a tradeoff between bandwidth and signal-to-noise ratio. If the bandwidth is increased, the channel capacity increases linearly. If the signal-to-noise ratio is increased, the channel capacity increases logarithmically. [1][2][3][5][7]\nError-free Communication: Shannon’s theorem states that if the data rate is below the channel capacity, it is possible to achieve arbitrarily low error rates through the use of appropriate coding techniques, such as error-correcting codes. However, if the data rate exceeds the channel capacity, the error rate will increase without bound, making reliable communication impossible. [2][7]\nFundamental Limit: The Shannon-Hartley theorem establishes a fundamental limit on the maximum achievable data rate for a given bandwidth and signal-to-noise ratio. This limit is a theoretical bound, and practical communication systems may not achieve the channel capacity due to various implementation constraints. [1][2][3][5][7]\nChannel Coding: The theorem implies the need for channel coding techniques to approach the channel capacity while maintaining a low error rate. Shannon’s work laid the foundation for the development of error-correcting codes, which add redundancy to the transmitted data to combat noise and errors in the channel. [2][6][7]\nBandwidth and Power Tradeoff: The theorem also highlights the tradeoff between bandwidth and power in communication systems. If the available bandwidth is limited, increasing the transmit power (and hence the signal-to-noise ratio) can increase the channel capacity. Conversely, if the transmit power is limited, increasing the bandwidth can also increase the channel capacity. [1][2][3][5][7]\n\nThe Shannon-Hartley theorem has had a profound impact on the design and analysis of modern communication systems, providing a theoretical foundation for understanding the limits of reliable data transmission and guiding the development of efficient coding and modulation techniques.\nCitations: [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon%E2%80%93Hartley_theorem [2] http://charleslee.yolasite.com/resources/elec321/lect_capacity.pdf [3] https://www.ingenu.com/2016/07/back-to-basics-the-shannon-hartley-theorem/?doing_wp_cron=1710843722.6885330677032470703125 [4] https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/hartley-theorem [5] https://dsp.stackexchange.com/questions/82831/what-is-the-intuition-explaining-the-shannon-hartley-theorem [6] https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/shannons-channel-capacity-timeless-formula-age-modern-woldegebreal [7] http://www.dip.ee.uct.ac.za/~nicolls/lectures/eee482f/04_chancap.pdf [8] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=altMVzt8eGg [9] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ekWsXeZ8TM [10] https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/548784/what-is-the-derivation-of-the-shannon-hartley-theorem"

    "section": "RISC Architecture",
    "text": "RISC Architecture\nRISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) is a design philosophy for CPUs, emphasizing a small and simple set of instructions that execute in a single clock cycle. RISC-V, on the other hand, is a specific, open-standard instruction set architecture (ISA) based on the RISC principles.\nWhile RISC and RISC-V are primarily associated with CPUs, the concepts and ISAs can be applied elsewhere. In fact, with the advent of more versatile computing platforms and the demand for specialized hardware accelerators, the lines between CPUs, GPUs, and other processing units can sometimes blur.\nGPUs and RISC\nGPUs (Graphics Processing Units) have a different historical design lineage than CPUs. While CPUs are designed for general-purpose tasks and can handle a wide variety of operations in sequence, GPUs are designed for parallelism, optimized for executing the same operation on a large number of data elements simultaneously. This design is especially suitable for graphics rendering tasks, where, for instance, the same shading operation might be applied to millions of pixels.\nThat said, modern GPUs have evolved and can handle more general-purpose tasks. This field, known as GPGPU (General-Purpose computing on Graphics Processing Units), has grown in prominence, especially with applications in scientific computing, machine learning, etc.\nThe instruction set architectures for GPUs are typically proprietary to the manufacturer: - NVIDIA GPUs use an architecture known as CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture). - AMD GPUs use architectures like GCN (Graphics Core Next) or RDNA.\nWhile these architectures might share some high-level concepts with RISC — like the importance of efficiency and streamlined operations — they’re not RISC architectures in the traditional sense.\nRISC-V and GPUs\nRISC-V, given its open nature, is seeing exploration beyond traditional CPUs. There are projects and discussions around using RISC-V principles in GPU design or other specialized hardware accelerators. However, as of my last training data in September 2021, RISC-V’s primary traction is in the CPU space, from microcontrollers to more powerful processors.\nIn conclusion, while RISC and RISC-V are primarily associated with CPUs, the principles and architectures are versatile. The GPU world has its architectures optimized for its specific tasks, but the lines between these domains are evolving, and there’s potential for overlap in the future.\n\nDesigning a VM for GPUs\nDesigning a virtual machine (VM) specifically optimized for GPUs and AI operations is not just a sensible idea, but it’s also a direction in which some sectors of the tech industry are heading. Let’s explore why this is a compelling notion and what features or characteristics such a VM might possess.\n\n\nRationale:\n\nSpecialized Operations: AI operations, especially deep learning, involve a lot of matrix multiplications and tensor operations. Traditional VMs are not optimized for these.\nMassive Parallelism: GPUs are inherently parallel and can handle thousands of threads simultaneously. A VM designed with this in mind would cater to this strength.\nMemory Management: Deep learning models, especially larger ones, can consume significant amounts of memory. Effective and efficient memory management tailored for these operations can greatly boost performance.\nInteroperability: AI frameworks and libraries are vast and varied (TensorFlow, PyTorch, ONNX, etc.). A VM optimized for AI could provide native support or efficient bridges for these frameworks.\n\n\n\nFeatures/Characteristics:\n\nTensor Operations: First-class support for tensor operations would be a fundamental feature. This means native operations for matrix multiplications, convolutions, etc., optimized for the VM.\nDynamic Scheduling: Given the parallel nature of GPUs, the VM should be capable of dynamically scheduling tasks based on GPU workloads, ensuring maximum hardware utilization.\nMemory Hierarchies: GPUs have various memory types (global, shared, local, constant). The VM should manage these efficiently, allocating memory based on access patterns and tensor sizes.\nCustom Instruction Sets: The VM’s bytecode or intermediate representation might have custom instructions tailored for common AI patterns and operations.\nJust-In-Time (JIT) Compilation: To squeeze out maximum performance, the VM could utilize JIT compilation, translating bytecode to GPU instructions on the fly, with optimizations based on the actual data and model being processed.\nHardware Acceleration: Besides standard GPU operations, there could be support for AI-specific hardware accelerators or ASICs (like Google’s TPUs).\nNative Libraries: Integrated support for popular deep learning libraries or primitives, ensuring optimized performance without redundant operations.\nSafety and Security: With AI models being deployed in critical applications, features to ensure model integrity, data privacy, and secure execution would be essential.\nPortability: One of the core benefits of a VM is portability. The VM should ensure that AI models run consistently across various GPU architectures and versions.\nInteroperability Bridges: Efficient connectors or bridges to interact with popular AI frameworks, ensuring smooth deployment without significant model rewrites.\nDebugging and Profiling: Built-in tools for performance profiling, debugging, and visualization, catering specifically to AI operations.\n\nIn essence, the idea of a virtual machine optimized for GPUs and AI operations seeks to bridge the gap between high-level AI frameworks and the raw power of GPU hardware. While creating such a VM is a non-trivial task and demands deep integration between software and hardware, the potential benefits in terms of performance, security, and portability make it a compelling direction for the future of AI infrastructure.\nAs of my last update in September 2021, there isn’t a mainstream “virtual machine” tailored explicitly for GPUs in the same way that the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) or the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) are for their respective domains. However, there are platforms and runtime environments optimized for GPU operations, especially in the context of AI/ML.\nSome of these platforms and their unique features include:\n\nCUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture):\n\nDeveloper & Manufacturer: NVIDIA\nUnique Features:\n\nProvides a parallel computing platform and API model.\nIncorporates the CUDA Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) and the parallel compute engine in NVIDIA GPUs.\nSupports various high-level programming languages like C, C++, and Fortran.\n\nUse Cases: General GPU-accelerated computing, scientific simulations, deep learning training & inference.\n\nTensorRT:\n\nDeveloper & Manufacturer: NVIDIA\nUnique Features:\n\nHigh-performance deep learning inference optimizer and runtime.\nReduces the model size for faster inferencing.\nProvides INT8 and FP16 optimizations for production deployments.\n\nUse Cases: Optimizing and deploying deep learning models for production environments, especially on NVIDIA GPUs.\n\nROCm (Radeon Open Compute):\n\nDeveloper & Manufacturer: AMD\nUnique Features:\n\nOpen-source platform for GPU-enabled HPC (High Performance Computing) computing.\nSupports a range of machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch.\n\nUse Cases: GPU-accelerated computing on AMD GPUs, scientific simulations, AI/ML training & inference.\n\nDirectML:\n\nDeveloper: Microsoft\nUnique Features:\n\nPart of the DirectX family, providing a low-level API for ML.\nHardware-accelerated and works with any DirectX 12-compatible GPU.\n\nUse Cases: GPU-accelerated ML inference in Windows applications.\n\n\nThese platforms are more akin to runtime environments than traditional “virtual machines.” Still, they are optimized for GPU operations, and they play a role similar to VMs by providing a bridge between high-level code and low-level hardware instructions.\nMain Benefits of GPU-optimized Platforms\n\nPerformance: Accelerate computations that can be parallelized, dramatically reducing the time required for tasks like training deep learning models.\nEfficiency: Better utilization of available GPU resources, ensuring that the hardware’s full capabilities are harnessed.\nPortability: In some cases (like CUDA to some extent), the platform provides an abstraction over the hardware, allowing code to run on different GPU architectures (within limits and considering vendor lock-ins).\nIntegration with Popular Tools: Many of these platforms offer integrations with popular ML frameworks, making it easier to transition from research to production.\n\nHowever, it’s essential to understand that while these platforms provide the tools and runtime for GPU-optimized operations, they don’t function as “virtual machines” in the traditional sense of emulating a complete computing environment. They are closer to specialized compilers and runtime environments."

The author argues that photonic quantum computers can perform computations orders of magnitude faster than superconducting qubit machines, even if every physical timescale of the photonic machine was slower. This is due to the unique properties of photonics, such as the ability to store/delay photons in long lengths of optical fiber with very low error rates, and the potential for active-volume architectures that can perform non-trivial computational gates more efficiently.\nNotes\n1. Photonic Quantum Computers: Photonic quantum computers use light (photons) to carry out quantum computations. They have the potential to perform computations faster than superconducting qubit machines due to their unique properties.\n2. Logical Gate Speed: The logical gate speed of a quantum computer is determined by the rate at which it can perform quantum logic gates. In photonic quantum computers, this is influenced by the rate of entangled photon production and the speed of optical switches.\n3. Interleaving: Photonic quantum computers can use a technique called interleaving, where many resource states are produced by a single resource state generator. This is possible due to the ability to store/delay photons in long lengths of optical fiber with very low error rates.\n4. Active-Volume Architectures: Active-volume architectures in photonic quantum computers can eliminate the majority of resource consumption expended on idling qubits by performing non-trivial computational gates. This is possible due to the ability to perform a limited number of non-nearest neighbor fusions between photons.\n5. Resource State Generation: The speed and scale of resource state generation is a critical factor in determining the logical gate speed of a photonic quantum computer. High repetition rates have been achieved in the production of single photons via a probabilistic parametric process.\n6. Future of Quantum Computing: The author believes that the long-term future of quantum computing is ultimately photonic due to the potential for high-speed resource state generation and the unique properties of photonics.\n7. Applications: The author provides an example of breaking elliptic curve cryptosystems on a quantum computer using Shor’s algorithm. He shows that a photonic quantum computer with an active-volume architecture can perform the computation significantly faster than a superconducting qubit machine.\n8. Conclusion: The author concludes that the logical gate speed of a photonic quantum computer is not solely determined by the physical timescales of the machine. Instead, it is influenced by the unique properties of photonics and the efficient parallelization achieved through long-range connections in the photonic active-volume device."

    "text": "The Evolution of Context Windows\n\nIntroduction\nThe context window—the maximum sequence length that a model can process in a single pass—is a hot topic in the field of large language models. It serves as a critical constraint for tasks that require understanding or generating longer sequences of text. From OpenAI’s ambitious goal of one million tokens to Magic’s announcement of a 5M token model, and Anthropic’s 100K context window model, we’re witnessing a context-length party. But why stop there? This article explores novel techniques and architectures that aim to stretch or even potentially eliminate these limitations.\n\n\nTL;DR\n\nContext window length limitations have been a bottleneck in the performance of large language models.\nVarious tricks like SuperHOT, and architectures like RWKV and Hyena, are breaking these limitations.\nEach approach comes with its trade-offs, but the direction is clear: larger context windows are inevitable.\n\n\n\nThe SuperHOT Method\nAbout two weeks ago, an innovative trick called SuperHOT surfaced on 4-chan. The user claimed that dividing the model’s positional encoding by 4 could trick the model into working with lengths 4 times longer than its original setting. The trick gained enough traction to be cited in academic papers. Following this, an anonymous Reddit user improved upon the idea, using non-linear interpolation to further enhance the performance of these “stretched” models. However, such tricks are not without drawbacks; performance dips and hyperparameter tuning are among the issues.\n\n\nInfinite Context with RWKV\nRWKV, known as the largest LSTM network in the world, is unique in its ability to theoretically offer an infinite context length. It ranks among the five best models in the Vicuna table and is one of the most used models on Huggingface. It’s not just good—it’s also cheap to run, operating at a lower computational cost than its Transformer counterparts.\n\n\nGPT-4: A Tangent on Architecture\nThe latest in the line of OpenAI’s GPT models, GPT-4 is a behemoth with eight different transformers and 220 billion parameters. Its architecture has sparked theories and speculation, some even suggesting that the model can dynamically change while running. It remains a remarkable but expensive framework, leading us to consider alternative architectures that can handle longer sequences more efficiently.\n\n\nGoodbye Transformers, Hello Hyena\nEnter Hyena, a convolution-based architecture that recently outperformed a larger Transformer model. It promises monstrous sequence lengths, faster computation, and possibly even higher accuracy. Hyena’s secret sauce is its ability to learn a map from position encoding to filter values, enabling more context-aware processing without the computational intensity of Transformers.\n\nThe Core Trick in Hyena\nHyena generates filters based on positional encoding. These filters are then applied in a Toeplitz matrix, which mimics the function of a convolution operation. This unique architecture allows Hyena to be as “data-controlled” as possible, similar to how attention layers work in Transformers but at a fraction of the computational cost.\n\n\n\nConclusion\nFrom tweaking positional encodings in the SuperHOT method to adopting entirely different architectures like RWKV and Hyena, the pursuit of longer context windows in large language models is more alive than ever. As we move forward, we can expect even more groundbreaking innovations that push the boundaries, opening new possibilities for applications that require understanding vast swaths of data in a single glance.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nGLam: Mixture of Experts\nSwitch Transformer\nRouted Language Models\nBranch-Train-Merge\nScaling Laws of Expert Networks\nCombining Knowledge Domains in MoE Nets\nHyena Paper\nHyena Blogs"

    "text": "Timeline of AI\nHistory of Artificial Neural Networks\nDeep Learning History\n\n\n\nFrank Rosenblatt invented the perceptron, an algorithm for pattern recognition, which is essentially a single-layer neural network.\n\n\n\nShortly after, he went on to explore deeper, multilayer perceptrons. His MLPs had a non-learning first layer with randomized weights and an adaptive output layer. Although this was not yet deep learning, because only the last layer learned.\n\n\n\nSuccessful learning in deep feedforward network architectures started in 1965 in the Ukraine (back then the USSR) when Alexey Ivakhnenko & Valentin Lapa introduced the first general, working learning algorithms for deep MLPs with arbitrarily many hidden layers (already containing the now popular multiplicative gates). A paper of 1971 already described a deep learning net with 8 layers, trained by their highly cited method which was still popular in the new millennium, especially in Eastern Europe, where much of Machine Learning was born.\n\n\n\nIvakhnenko and Lapa (1965, see above) trained their deep networks layer by layer. In 1967, however, Shun-Ichi Amari suggested to train MLPs with many layers in non-incremental end-to-end fashion from scratch by stochastic gradient descent, a method proposed in 1951 by Robbins & Monro.\nAmari’s implementation (with his student Saito) learned internal representations in a five layer MLP with two modifiable layers, which was trained to classify non-linearily separable pattern classes.\n\n\n\nKunihiko Fukushima introduced rectified linear units (ReLUs) for NNs (1969). They are now widely used in CNNs and other NNs.\n\n\n\nSeppo Linnainmaa was the first to publish what’s now known as backpropagation, the famous algorithm for credit assignment in networks of differentiable nodes, also known as “reverse mode of automatic differentiation.” It is now the foundation of widely used NN software packages such as PyTorch and Google’s Tensorflow.\n\n\n\nAmari published a paper on Amari-Hopfield networks, which resemble what’s now known as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).\n\n\n\nComputer Vision was revolutionized in the 2010s by a particular feedforward NN called the convolutional NN (CNN). The basic CNN architecture with alternating convolutional and downsampling layers is due to Kunihiko Fukushima, 1979. He called it Neocognitron.\n\n\n\n\nThe Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry set aside $850 million for the Fifth generation computer project.\nThe UK began the £350 million Alvey project.\nDARPA founded the Strategic Computing Initiative and tripling its investment in AI between 1984 and 1988.\n\n\n\n\n\nPhysicist John Hopfield was able to prove that a form of neural network (now called a “Hopfield net”) could learn and process information in a completely new way. This built on the Amari-Hopfield network from Amari’s 1972 publication\n\n\n\n\nGeoffrey Hinton “godfather of AI” invented the idea of multilayered neural networks, with nodes and weights. Node takes inputs and weights of inputs, outputs a signal if sum &gt; 0. - 1985 | A Learning Algorithm for Boltzmann Machines - 1986 | Learning representations by back-propagating errors\n\n\n\nDavid E. Rumelhart demonstrated that backpropagation can yield useful internal representations in hidden layers of NNs. At least for supervised learning, backpropagation is generally more efficient than Amari’s above-mentioned deep learning through the more general SGD method (1967), which learned useful internal representations in NNs about 2 decades earlier\nFeng-hsiung Hsu begins development on Chess-playing expert system called ChipTest. In 1988 it was moved to IBM and renamed Deep Thought, and then renamed again in 1989 to Deep Blue.\n\n\n\nGenerative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are first published in 1990 in Munich under the moniker Artificial Curiosity. Two dueling NNs (a probabilistic generator and a predictor) are trying to maximize each other’s loss in a minimax game. The generator (called the controller) generates probabilistic outputs (using stochastic units like in the much later StyleGANs). The predictor (called the world model) sees the outputs of the controller and predicts environmental reactions to them. Using gradient descent, the predictor NN minimizes its error, while the generator NN tries to make outputs that maximize this error: one net’s loss is the other net’s gain\n\n\n\nJiirgen Schmidhuber published a paper describing an alternative to RNNs: A feedforward NN slowly learns by gradient descent to program the changes of the fast weights of another NN. Such Fast Weight Programmers (FWPs) can learn to memorize past data, too. In 1991, one of them computed its fast weight changes through additive outer products of self-invented activation patterns (now often called keys and values for self-attention). The very similar Transformers combine this with projections and softmax and are now widely used in natural language processing. For long input sequences, their efficiency was improved through Transformers with linearized self-attention whose core is formally equivalent to the 1991 Fast Weight Programmers.\n\n\n\nSepp Hochreiter and Jurgen Schmidhuber published Long Short-Term Memory, the most cited NN paper of the 20th century. A later milestone was the “vanilla LSTM architecture” with forget gate — the LSTM variant of 1999-2000 that everybody is using today, e.g., in Google’s Tensorflow. Alex was lead author of our first successful application of LSTM to speech (2004). 2005 saw the first publication of LSTM with full backpropagation through time and of bi-directional LSTM (now widely used).\nAlso in 1997, Deep Blue beats Gary Kasparov in chess.\n\n\n\nImageNet is created, a large visual database envisioned by Fei-Fei Li from Stanford University, who realized that the best machine learning algorithms wouldn’t work well if the data didn’t reflect the real world. For many, ImageNet was the catalyst for the AI boom of the 21st century.\n\n\n\nX (formerly Google X) is an American semi-secret research and development facility and organization founded by Google in January 2010.

Google Brain started as a Google X project and became so successful that it was graduated back to Google: Astro Teller has said that Google Brain paid for the entire cost of Google X.\n\n\n\nGeoffrey Hinton tests artificial deep neural network on a widely used image recogniztion test, called ImageNet. AlexNet was the program, scored 75% success, way better than competitors. This generates a ton of hype, and sparks more funding/research in AI, particularly image recognition.\n\n\n\nIn 2013, Geoffrey Hinton was acqui-hired by Google.\n\n\n\nThe attention mechanism is introduced, which would became the foundation for the Transformer.\n\n\n\nIn December 2015, Sam Altman, Greg Brockman, Reid Hoffman, Jessica Livingston, Peter Thiel, Elon Musk, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Infosys, and YC Research announced the formation of OpenAI and pledged over $1 billion to the venture.\nDecember 11, 2015 announcement by Greg Brockman and Ilya Sutskever.\n\n\n\n\nAlphaGo becomes supreme at Go\nGoogle Brain neural network learns secure encryption\n\nDecember 2016, OpenAI released “Universe”, a software platform for measuring and training an AI’s general intelligence across the world’s supply of games, websites, and other applications.

This weighs the importance of different parts of the input without having to maintain internal state. Much easier to parallize, and eliminates vanishing & exploding gradient problem.\nAlso 2017, Tesla poaches deep learning expert Andrej Karpathy from OpenAI to be its new head of Autopilot Vision.\n\n\n\n\nOpenAI Charter is published, which is later cited upon holding back powerful models like GPT-2.\nElon leaves OpenAI In early 2018, Musk told Sam Altman, another OpenAI founder, that he believed the venture had fallen fatally behind Google, people familiar with the matter said. Musk proposed a possible solution: He would take control of OpenAI and run it himself.\n\nAltman and OpenAI’s other founders rejected Musk’s proposal. Musk, in turn, walked away from the company — and reneged on a massive planned donation. The fallout from that conflict, culminating in the announcement of Musk’s departure on Feb 20, 2018, would shape the industry that’s changing the world, and the company at the heart of it.\nFebruary 20, 2018 announcement that Elon is departing.

    "section": "",
    "text": "This is notes on a lecture by Eric Weinstein on the topic of geometric unity. The lecture is available here.\nI am first watching this lecture without a proper background in tensor calculus, dirac notation, or differential geometry. My plan is first to listen, ponder curiously, explore the topics which I need to learn, and return once I’m able to independently generate an opinion with conviction.\n\n\nEdward Witten gave 3 main insights/assumptions, they correspond to the 3 great equations\n(1) Physics takes place in an arena\nThat arena is a manifold x together with some kind of semi-Riemannian metric structure: something that allows us to take length and angle, so that we can perform measurements at everypoint in spacetime or higher dimensional structure.\nThe equation associated with this is the Einstein Field Equation.\n\\[ R_{\\mu\\nu} - \\frac{1}{2} R g_{\\mu\\nu} + \\Lambda g_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{8 \\pi G}{c^4} T_{\\mu\\nu} \\]\n\n\\(R_{\\mu\\nu}\\) is the Ricci tensor, which encodes information about the curvature of spacetime.\n\\(R\\) is the Ricci scalar, a measure of the overall curvature of spacetime.\n\\(g_{\\mu\\nu}\\) is the metric tensor, which describes the geometry of spacetime.\n\\(\\Lambda\\) is the cosmological constant, which represents the energy density of the vacuum of space.\n\\(G\\) is the gravitational constant, which determines the strength of the gravitational interaction.\n\\(c\\) is the speed of light in vacuum, which sets the scale for the relationship between space and time.\n\\(T_{\\mu\\nu}\\) is the stress-energy tensor, which describes the distribution of matter and energy in spacetime.\n\n(2) Symmetry groups are fundamental. They cannot be deduced from any structure inside the arena. They are additional data that come to us “out of the blue”, wihtout any explanation. These symmetries create a non-abelian group, which is currently:\n\\[\\mathrm{SU}(3) \\times \\mathrm{SU}(2) \\times \\mathrm{U}(1)\\]\ndef. non-abelian group: sometimes called a non-commutative group, is a group in which there exists at least one pair of elements a and b of G, such that a ∗ b ≠ b ∗ a.\nThis has a corresponding curvature equation, that says the curvature of an auxillary structure known as a guage potential, when differentiated in a particular way, is again equal to “the amount of stuff in the system that is not directly involved in the equation above”.\n\\[d^*_A F_A = J(\\psi)\\]\n\n\\(d_A\\) is the exterior covariant derivative associated with the connection A. It is a generalization of the standard exterior derivative to take into account the nontrivial connection structure of the gauge field.\n\\(F_A\\) is the curvature 2-form of the connection A. It encodes the non-Abelian nature of the gauge field and is given by the commutator of the connection 1-forms.\n\\(d_A^*\\) is the adjoint of the exterior covariant derivative, known as the codifferential. It maps p-forms to (p-1)-forms and is defined with respect to the metric on the underlying spacetime manifold.\n\\(J(\\psi)\\) is the source term associated with a spinor field ψ. It is usually expressed in terms of the Dirac equation, which relates the spinor ψ to a massless field that obeys the wave equation. The source term J encodes the coupling of the spinor to the gauge field, and in the case of the electromagnetic field, it is proportional to the electric charge of the particle.\n\nThe equation \\(d_A^* F_A = J(\\psi)\\) is a local differential equation that relates the curvature of a gauge field to the sources that generate it. It is a key ingredient in the formulation of gauge theories such as quantum chromodynamics and the electroweak theory, which describe the strong and electroweak interactions in particle physics.

    "title": "Geometric Unity",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This is notes on a lecture by Eric Weinstein on the topic of geometric unity. The lecture is available here.\nI am first watching this lecture without a proper background in tensor calculus, dirac notation, or differential geometry. My plan is first to listen, ponder curiously, explore the topics which I need to learn, and return once I’m able to independently generate an opinion with conviction.\n\n\nEdward Witten gave 3 main insights/assumptions, they correspond to the 3 great equations\n(1) Physics takes place in an arena\nThat arena is a manifold x together with some kind of semi-Riemannian metric structure: something that allows us to take length and angle, so that we can perform measurements at everypoint in spacetime or higher dimensional structure.\nThe equation associated with this is the Einstein Field Equation.\n\\[ R_{\\mu\\nu} - \\frac{1}{2} R g_{\\mu\\nu} + \\Lambda g_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{8 \\pi G}{c^4} T_{\\mu\\nu} \\]\n\n\\(R_{\\mu\\nu}\\) is the Ricci tensor, which encodes information about the curvature of spacetime.\n\\(R\\) is the Ricci scalar, a measure of the overall curvature of spacetime.\n\\(g_{\\mu\\nu}\\) is the metric tensor, which describes the geometry of spacetime.\n\\(\\Lambda\\) is the cosmological constant, which represents the energy density of the vacuum of space.\n\\(G\\) is the gravitational constant, which determines the strength of the gravitational interaction.\n\\(c\\) is the speed of light in vacuum, which sets the scale for the relationship between space and time.\n\\(T_{\\mu\\nu}\\) is the stress-energy tensor, which describes the distribution of matter and energy in spacetime.\n\n(2) Symmetry groups are fundamental. They cannot be deduced from any structure inside the arena. They are additional data that come to us “out of the blue”, wihtout any explanation. These symmetries create a non-abelian group, which is currently:\n\\[\\mathrm{SU}(3) \\times \\mathrm{SU}(2) \\times \\mathrm{U}(1)\\]\ndef. non-abelian group: sometimes called a non-commutative group, is a group in which there exists at least one pair of elements a and b of G, such that a ∗ b ≠ b ∗ a.\nThis has a corresponding curvature equation, that says the curvature of an auxillary structure known as a guage potential, when differentiated in a particular way, is again equal to “the amount of stuff in the system that is not directly involved in the equation above”.\n\\[d^*_A F_A = J(\\psi)\\]\n\n\\(d_A\\) is the exterior covariant derivative associated with the connection A. It is a generalization of the standard exterior derivative to take into account the nontrivial connection structure of the gauge field.\n\\(F_A\\) is the curvature 2-form of the connection A. It encodes the non-Abelian nature of the gauge field and is given by the commutator of the connection 1-forms.\n\\(d_A^*\\) is the adjoint of the exterior covariant derivative, known as the codifferential. It maps p-forms to (p-1)-forms and is defined with respect to the metric on the underlying spacetime manifold.\n\\(J(\\psi)\\) is the source term associated with a spinor field ψ. It is usually expressed in terms of the Dirac equation, which relates the spinor ψ to a massless field that obeys the wave equation. The source term J encodes the coupling of the spinor to the gauge field, and in the case of the electromagnetic field, it is proportional to the electric charge of the particle.\n\nThe equation \\(d_A^* F_A = J(\\psi)\\) is a local differential equation that relates the curvature of a gauge field to the sources that generate it. It is a key ingredient in the formulation of gauge theories such as quantum chromodynamics and the electroweak theory, which describe the strong and electroweak interactions in particle physics. It also has applications in other areas of physics, such as condensed matter physics and general relativity.\n(3) Matter is assymetric and therefore light.\nWe have a Dirac equation coupled to a connection\n\\[ \\phi_A \\psi = \\mu \\psi \\]\n\nIn this equation, \\(\\psi\\) is a spinor field and \\(\\phi_A\\) is a differential operator that acts on \\(\\psi\\). The index \\(A\\) can represent different kinds of symmetry groups, such as the gauge group in a gauge theory. The equation states that the action of the operator \\(\\phi_A\\) on the spinor field \\(\\psi\\) yields a scalar multiple of \\(\\psi\\) with eigenvalue \\(\\mu\\). In other words, \\(\\psi\\) is an eigenvector of \\(\\phi_A\\) with eigenvalue \\(\\mu\\).\n\n\nThis equation has applications in several areas of physics, such as quantum field theory and condensed matter physics. For example, in condensed matter physics, \\(\\phi_A\\) can represent the Hamiltonian of a system, and \\(\\psi\\) can represent a wave function that describes the state of the system.

It is currently unable to confirm or deny whether it has discovered any verifiable information to substantiate claims that any current or former U.S. programs have had possession or reverse-engineered materials from non-human intelligences or unknown origin.\nDepartment of Defense (DoD) Stance: The DoD spokesperson, Susan Gough, stated that the AARO has not discovered any verifiable information to substantiate such claims. However, she declined to comment further on whether the term “extraterrestrial” could extend to materials of unknown origin or non-human intelligences.\nAccess to Information: Gough confirmed that the AARO has not been denied access to any U.S. government program, past or present, during the course of its work. She also stated that the AARO may receive all UAP-related information, including any classified national security information involving military, intelligence, and intelligence-related activities, at all levels of classification regardless of any restrictive access controls, special access programs, or compartmented access programs.\nTitle 50 Authorities: Gough addressed the issue of Title 50 authorities, stating that such authorities are unrelated to the AARO’s ability to receive all UAP-related information through authorized disclosures.\nPublic Affairs Policies: Gough explained that it is DoD policy that all interactions with the news media at the Department level, including press queries, are coordinated with the Office of the Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs. She also noted that her portfolio includes UAP, AARO, and the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence & Security, as well as other issues and offices.\nWhistleblower Trust: The blog post mentions that the AARO, which currently reports to the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence & Security, is not trusted by numerous whistleblowers. The issue may stem from the AARO’s proximity to the OUSDI&S, which has previously been criticized for allegedly persecuting whistleblowers.\nConclusion: The blog post concludes by noting that the National Defense Authorization Act of 2023 means that the AARO should report directly to Deputy Secretary of Defense, Kathleen Hicks, and the Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence on all operational and security matters relating to the AARO. However, there is no indication that this has been implemented yet."

    "section": "Explanation",
    "text": "Explanation\nSuperconductivity requires a spin-up electron to pair with a spin-down electron, so that the pair has a net spin of zero and therefore obeys Bose-Einstein statistics, not Fermi-Dirac. This breaks them free from the Pauli exclusion principle, so you can have a great many of them occupying a low energy quantum state that can slide effortlessly through the material like a ghost. Every superconductor relies on exactly that effect.\nWhat differs between materials is the way in which the electrons pair. Electrons don’t like to pair, because of their mutual Coulomb repulsion, but in some materials they can both jiggle the crystal lattice in a way that weakly brings them together, like an arranged marriage for a couple that’s not really into each other. This is called phonon coupling, and can be modeled with BCS theory, at least… for simple crystal structures. That model predicts that superconductivity can only occur up to like 30 K, beyond which the lattice is jostling around too much because of temperature, so the pairing mechanism is disrupted.\nHowever, there are some materials with complicated crystal structures, that get around the assumptions of BCS, and that are more robust when it comes to the effect of temperature on the pairing mechanism. For example, ReBCO, which I work with, can go up to ~90 K. This is a shockingly high number from the perspective of BCS, which is why these materials are called “high temperature” superconductors, despite still having to be pretty cold (liquid nitrogen boils at 77 K).\nAnyway, the high T superconductors have more complicated and exotic pairing mechanisms. It’s no longer “simple” phonon coupling, but something that involves longer-range and more geometrically complicated details, and to this day it’s still not fully understood.\nAlthough, the way supercurrent flows is well-understood, in all superconductors. It’s called the Ginsburg-Landau model, and is based on the idea that there’s some energy associated with electron pair formation, and some energy associated with pair-to-pair interactions, in addition to the usual electromagnetic terms. This model works extremely well, and is the basis for all superconducting technology.\nOne of the predictions of GL is that, when the condensation energy is nearly zero (around the Tc), there will be fluctuations where electrons temporarily pair and un-pair. These oscillations are extremely rapid, so in experiential measurements they will average out into a state that seems to be kinda superconducting, but not completely. But it’s really just fluctuating, a second-order phase transition. So that’s one cause of the transition width.\nAnother cause of the transition width is the purity of the sample, or lack thereof. A sample with varying quality throughout will have a wider transition, as some parts of it “turn on” before others.\nWith ReBCO, transition widths are typically a few K, with tails noticeable out to like a 10 K span, sometimes more. And dirty samples might have double or triple transitions, if different parts of it are oriented different ways.\nAnyway, sorry for the novel of a response, but I hope that provides some context. Any Tc curve on a new superconducting sample is probably going to have quite a wide transition, for lack of sample purity, and also due to the fluctuations that thermodynamically should be there no matter what. So it seems extremely unlikely that a material which somehow superconducts at 4X the temperature of ReBCO would also have a much cleaner Tc transition.\ncredit"

In the talk, he explores this question by analyzing the ups and downs of quantum field theory throughout its history.\nSummary\nQuantum Field Theory was born just pertaining to the electromagnetic field. When expanding this theory, it seemed it couldn’t be trusted at high energies. In the late 1940s, there was a new optimizing with the invention of a relatavistic perturbation theory, where the infinities could be absorbed into a redefinition of parameters like mass and charge of the electron. People thought this was sweeping problems under the rug, but it also may have been a way of selecting good theories (renormalizable theories). For example, theere’s nothing in the symmetries of quantum electrodynamics which rules out putting a term in the field equations (or Lagrangian), which could make the magnetic moment of the electron anything you want. This would make the mass of the electron -1, which means the theory is not renormalizable, and thus shows invalid.\nIn the late 1960s and early 70s, the standard model came to fruition - this was the renaissance of Quantum Field theory. But there were still doubts whether this was a fundamental theory or an effective one.\nQuantum Field Theory & Einsteinian Physics may be low energy approximations of a more fundamental theory."

The formal definition is:\n\\[ \\begin{aligned}\nM \\subset B(H) \\text{ is a von Neumann algebra if } M = M'' = (M')'\n\\end{aligned} \\]\nHere, \\((B(H))\\) denotes the set of bounded linear operators on Hilbert space \\((H)\\), and \\((M'')\\) and \\((M')\\) denote the bicommutant and commutant, respectively.\n\nTypes of Von Neumann Algebras\n\nType I\n\nDescription: Decomposable into direct sums of simple matrix algebras.\nSubtypes:\n\nType I\\((_1)\\): Factors corresponding to finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces.\nType I\\((_\\infty)\\): Infinite-dimensional spaces.\n\n\nType II\n\nDescription: Not decomposable but have a non-trivial center.\nSubtypes:\n\nType II\\((_1)\\): Trace-class operators have finite trace.\nType II\\((_\\infty)\\): Infinite trace.\n\n\nType III\n\nDescription: Neither Type I nor Type II; occur naturally in quantum field theory.\nSubtypes:\n\nType III\\((_\\lambda)\\): Vary by a parameter \\((\\lambda)\\), used in the Tomita-Takesaki theory.\n\n\n\nEach type has distinct mathematical properties and applications in quantum mechanics and quantum field theory.\n\n\n\nHilbert Space\nA Hilbert space is a complete inner product space, meaning it’s a vector space equipped with an inner product and is complete in the sense that every Cauchy sequence in the space converges to an element within the space. It generalizes the notion of Euclidean space and is fundamental in quantum mechanics and functional analysis.\n\\[ \\begin{aligned}\n\\langle x, y \\rangle : H \\times H \\rightarrow \\mathbb{C}\n\\end{aligned} \\]\n\nContext: Developed in early 20th century, named after David Hilbert.\nPurpose: Framework for quantum mechanics and functional analysis."

Agaritines are hydrazines that are heat unstable, so the good news is, you should cook them, and if you cook them well, then those mushrooms are not a problem. If you don’t cook them well, then these hydrazines are potentially problematic.\n\n\nNow, nature’s a numbers game: so, there are beneficial compounds, that, in some balance, may outweigh the negative effects of the hydrazines, the agaratines in these mushrooms, but that jury is still out so to speak.\n\n\n\n\n\nAgaritine from Agaricus blazei Murrill induces apoptosis in the leukemic cell line U937\n\nAgaritine, a compound found in the medicinal mushroom Agaricus blazei Murrill, induces apoptosis (programmed cell death) in the leukemic cell line U937.\nAgaritine treatment caused a dose-dependent increase in apoptosis in U937 cells, as measured by the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria and the activation of caspases.\nAgaritine also induced the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins, such as Bax and Fas, and inhibited the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins, such as Bcl-2.\nThese findings suggest that agaritine may have potential as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of leukemia.\nAgaritine treatment caused a significant increase in the number of apoptotic cells in U937 cultures, as measured by flow cytometry.\nAgaritine also induced the characteristic morphological changes of apoptosis, such as nuclear condensation and fragmentation.\nWestern blot analysis showed that agaritine treatment increased the expression of Bax and Fas, and decreased the expression of Bcl-2.\nThese findings suggest that agaritine may trigger apoptosis in U937 cells by activating caspases and upregulating pro-apoptotic proteins.\nThe authors of the paper concluded that agaritine may have potential as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of leukemia. However, further studies are needed to confirm these findings and to determine the optimal dose and schedule of agaritine treatment.\n\nQuantities of agaritine in mushrooms (Agaricus bisporus) and the carcinogenicity of mushroom methanol extracts on the mouse bladder epithelium\n\nAgaritine is a carcinogenic compound found in mushrooms, including Agaricus bisporus (white button mushrooms).\nThe authors of the paper measured the levels of agaritine in Agaricus bisporus mushrooms and found that the levels varied depending on the growing conditions.\nThe authors also found that methanol extracts of Agaricus bisporus mushrooms were carcinogenic to the mouse bladder epithelium.\nThese findings suggest that agaritine may be a risk factor for bladder cancer in humans.\nThe authors measured the levels of agaritine in Agaricus bisporus mushrooms grown in different conditions, including open fields, greenhouses, and dark rooms.\nThe levels of agaritine were highest in mushrooms grown in dark rooms, followed by mushrooms grown in greenhouses, and then mushrooms grown in open fields.\nThe authors also found that methanol extracts of Agaricus bisporus mushrooms were carcinogenic to the mouse bladder epithelium.\nThis was determined by the induction of tumors in the mouse bladder after treatment with the methanol extracts. The authors concluded that agaritine may be a risk factor for bladder cancer in humans.\n\nSynthetic and Naturally Occurring Hydrazines as Possible Cancer Causative Agents\n\nHydrazines are a class of compounds that have been shown to be carcinogenic in animals.\nSeveral synthetic hydrazines have been shown to cause cancer in humans, including 1,2-diethylhydrazine, 1,2-dinitrohydrazine, and 1,2-dibromohydrazine. Hydrazines are also found naturally in some foods, including mushrooms, tobacco, and fish.\nThere is some evidence that naturally occurring hydrazines may also be carcinogenic, but more research is needed to confirm this.\nThe authors of the paper conclude that hydrazines are a potential risk factor for cancer, and that further research is needed to determine the extent of this risk.\nThe authors reviewed the literature on hydrazines and cancer, and identified 19 synthetic hydrazines that have been shown to be carcinogenic in animals.\nThe authors also identified several naturally occurring hydrazines that have been found in foods, including agaritine, gyromitrin, and BMAA.\nThe authors concluded that hydrazines are a potential risk factor for cancer, and that further research is needed to determine the extent of this risk. It is important to note that this paper was published in 1975, and there has been some research on hydrazines and cancer since then. However, the authors’ conclusions are still valid, and further research is still needed to determine the extent of the risk of cancer from hydrazines.\n\nGenotoxicity of agaritine in the lacI transgenic mouse mutation assay: evaluation of the health risk of mushroom consumption\n\nGoogle Bard would not summarize this paper as it did for every other one (???)\n\n\nUsing a previously derived quantitative correlation between mutagenicity in the lacI test and carcinogenic potency, the carcinogenicity of agaritine in mushrooms was estimated: the average Swiss mushroom consumption of 4 g/day would be expected to contribute a lifetime cumulative cancer risk of about two cases per 100,000 lives.\n\nAttempted tumor induction with agaritine in mice."

Hydrazines are also found naturally in some foods, including mushrooms, tobacco, and fish.\nThere is some evidence that naturally occurring hydrazines may also be carcinogenic, but more research is needed to confirm this.\nThe authors of the paper conclude that hydrazines are a potential risk factor for cancer, and that further research is needed to determine the extent of this risk.\nThe authors reviewed the literature on hydrazines and cancer, and identified 19 synthetic hydrazines that have been shown to be carcinogenic in animals.\nThe authors also identified several naturally occurring hydrazines that have been found in foods, including agaritine, gyromitrin, and BMAA.\nThe authors concluded that hydrazines are a potential risk factor for cancer, and that further research is needed to determine the extent of this risk. It is important to note that this paper was published in 1975, and there has been some research on hydrazines and cancer since then. However, the authors’ conclusions are still valid, and further research is still needed to determine the extent of the risk of cancer from hydrazines.\n\nGenotoxicity of agaritine in the lacI transgenic mouse mutation assay: evaluation of the health risk of mushroom consumption\n\nGoogle Bard would not summarize this paper as it did for every other one (???)\n\n\nUsing a previously derived quantitative correlation between mutagenicity in the lacI test and carcinogenic potency, the carcinogenicity of agaritine in mushrooms was estimated: the average Swiss mushroom consumption of 4 g/day would be expected to contribute a lifetime cumulative cancer risk of about two cases per 100,000 lives.\n\nAttempted tumor induction with agaritine in mice."

The normal and subnormal subjects found the upper regions of the face most helpful for identification, whereas the younger autistic children found the lower features more helpful. The older autistic children showed no specific reliance on any one area, but were found to have error scores as low as those of the younger autistic children on the recognition of lower parts and error scores as low as the; controls on recognizing upper portions.

We tracked 4–12-mo-old English-learning infants’ and adults’ eye gaze while they watched and listened to a female reciting a monologue either in their native (English) or nonnative (Spanish) language. We found that infants shifted their attention from the eyes to the mouth between 4 and 8 mo of age regardless of language and then began a shift back to the eyes at 12 mo in response to native but not nonnative speech. We posit that the first shift enables infants to gain access to redundant audiovisual speech cues that enable them to learn their native speech forms and that the second shift reflects growing native-language expertise that frees them to shift attention to the eyes to gain access to social cues. On this account, 12-mo-old infants do not shift attention to the eyes when exposed to nonnative speech because increasing native-language expertise and perceptual narrowing make it more difficult to process nonnative speech and require them to continue to access redundant audiovisual cues.

We also found that the unwarranted effects of masks were not due to holistic processes, because the Face Inversion Effect (FIE) was generally not larger with unmasked compared with masked faces. Moreover, we found that the impact of masks is not automatic and that under some contexts observers can control at least part of their detrimental effects.\n\nFace masks reduce emotion-recognition accuracy and perceived closeness\n\nAgain, this was on adults, because you wouldn’t be able to publish your findings in 2021 if you exposed what it does to children\n\n\nIMPORTANT\n\nEmotion comprehension between 3 and 11 years: Developmental periods and hierarchical organization\nDarwin’s Contributions of our Understanding of Emotional Expressions\nInfants deploy selective attention to the mouth of a talking face when learning speech\nPotential Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Communication and Language Skills in Children\nEffect of face mask and noise on word recognition by children and adults\n\nThis PDF was taken off the web!

Moreover, we found that the impact of masks is not automatic and that under some contexts observers can control at least part of their detrimental effects.\n\nFace masks reduce emotion-recognition accuracy and perceived closeness\n\nAgain, this was on adults, because you wouldn’t be able to publish your findings in 2021 if you exposed what it does to children\n\n\nIMPORTANT\n\nEmotion comprehension between 3 and 11 years: Developmental periods and hierarchical organization\nDarwin’s Contributions of our Understanding of Emotional Expressions\nInfants deploy selective attention to the mouth of a talking face when learning speech\nPotential Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Communication and Language Skills in Children\nEffect of face mask and noise on word recognition by children and adults\n\nThis PDF was taken off the web!

    "text": "Learnings from the history of money.\n\nContext\nBy the 6th century B.C., Western money standards began to converge around the use of stamped metal coins. One of the earliest dominant currencies was the Athenian silver tetradrachm, which gained dominance over the gold/silver coins issued by Persia and other western empires of the time. Aside from the economic success and naval hegemony of ancient Athens, factors contributing to the currency’s success were large circulating supply, fine quality, and unchanging appearance. Nevertheless, the “dominance” of Athenian money was limited, as dozens of currencies remained in use in local circulation.\n\n\nThe Rise of Rome, and the Globalization of Money\nFollowing the rise of the Roman Empire, the introduction of the Roman silver denarius around 211 B.C. marked a turning point in Western money. The denarius effectively fixed the previously-fluctuating relationship between silver and bronze, with one silver denarius (containing ~4.5g of silver) exchangeable for 10 bronze asses, (the as was a bronze coin of the time). Gold was used less frequently, until Julius Ceasar standardized the gold aureus (8g of gold) to 25 denarii. The success of Roman imperialism expanded adoption of the aureus/denarius/as standard farther than any currency prior. Rome effectively established the (Western) globalization of hard money.\nThese currencies and their respective exchange rates remained impressively stable through the turmoil caused by the assassination of Julius Ceasar in 44 B.C. Many historians credit the strength of Roman money as a crucial foundation for the 200-year golden age of Rome, known as the Pax Romana, which lasted from 27 B.C. to 170 A.D.\n\n\nCoin Clipping: The Beginning of the End\nAround the middle of the Pax Romana, however, Emperor Nero made a monetary decision that, in retrospect, appears to mark the beginning of the end of Roman economic prowess. When faced with increasing government expenditures, Emperor Nero became the first to engage in what is known as coin clipping: the emperor would recall the coins then mint them into a new coin with a lower metallic content but with the same face value. This is currency debasement - it marked the introduction of government-induced inflation in Rome.\nIt’s important to note that currency debasement proved to be successful in the short term. The decision to begin coin clipping may be responsible for successfully extending the period of Roman peace, as over the reign of the next several Emperors, economic prosperity and peace continued as inflation remained below half a percent.\nOver the next two hundred years, however, it became clear that the temporary relief provided by currency debasement (coin clipping) would eventually demand further debasement. Rome was permanently prohibited from returning to a non-inflationary economy, and thus engaged in a vicious cycle:\ncurrency debasement → price increases → price controls → further debasement\nIn the long run, coin clipping only increased the magnitude of the problems Emperor Nero set to solve. This cycle ravaged Rome through centuries of political and economic instability, until Constantine managed to restore stability through significant monetary reform.\n\n\nHard Money to the Rescue… Too Late\nConstantine issued the gold solidus in 312 A.D. at a weight of 4.55 grams, permanently replacing the aureus. The solidus was worth 275,000 debased denarii, which now contained ~5% silver, down from the original 95%.\nConstantine required the fixed weight of the solidus, without debasement, which finally established Roman economic stability.\nThe recovery of the Roman economy came too late, as continuing foreign invasions led to the collapse of the Western Roman Empire. However, the gold solidus was so successful that it remained the currency of the Byzantine Empire (Eastern Rome) centuries after the fall of the Western Empire. To this day, the gold solidus remains a candidate for the most successful currency in the history of the world.\n\n\nSources\n\nInflation Under the Roman Empire\nMoney and Prices in the Ancient Roman Empire\nMoney and Exchange in the Roman World\nThe Monetary Systems of the Roman Empire from Diocletian to Theodosius I\nRome: A Thousand Years of Monetary History"

    "text": "Cypherpunks\nThe commonality of this misconception may be explained, at least in part, by the founding culture associated with blockchain technology. Blockchain technology emerged in the late 20th century from several key innovations in the field of cryptography, the same field from which the manifestation of informational privacy (encryption), was pioneered.\nThe Cypherpunks were a group of cryptographic enthusiasts who advocated for the use of cryptography and similar methods as ways to achieve societal and political change. Founded in the early 1990s, the movement has been most active during the 1990s “cryptowars” and following the 2011 internet spring. The Cypherpunks forecasted the coming age of digital information, and saw cryptography as a means of preserving fundamental individual rights, such privacy and self-sovereignty. Members of this group include Roger Dingledine, co-founder of the Tor Project, Julian Assange, founder of Wikileaks, and perhaps most notably, Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin.\nMany of the protocols, algorithms, and applications developed by the Cypherpunks were centered around privacy. Bitcoin was not."

    "text": "The Genesis Case Study, Bitcoin\n\nPseudonymity != Anonymity\nIn October of 2008, an email from Satoshi Nakamoto was sent to the cypherpunk email list, titled “Bitcoin P2P e-cash paper”.\nParticipation in the Bitcoin network only requires a public/private keypair (ECDSA for Version 1). There is no support for “accounts” or “profiles” which include other metadata, such as name, email, address, etc. Thus, the Bitcoin network is inherently pseudonymous, where the pseudonyms are Bitcoin addresses (smaller hashed versions of the public key). On the Bitcoin network, all transactions are published to and stored on the public ledger (this allows for Bitcoin’s distributed consensus), making intra-network forensics trivial. I.e. it is trivial to retreive the entire financial history of 1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa, and verifiably gather information on all transactions involving this address, neighboring addresses, etc.\nStill, it remains theoretically possible to use Bitcoin anonymously. A Bitcoin user may rely on proper operational security (OpSec) techniques to ensure his/her Bitcoin pseudonym remains entirely disjunct from his/her “real” or government identity. In the early days of Bitcoin, the majority of participants did successfully maintain anonymity through proper OpSec - accessing the network through VPNs, public WiFi hotspots, remote SSH tunneling, etc.\nOne factor contributing to the early success of anonymity was the fact that the earliest users of Bitcoin were often well-versed in digital OpSec. Early users generated and custodied their keypairs on a local and/or secure machine because they were familiar with ECDSA encryption, and they executed Bitcoin payments under anonymous identities on secure e-commerce platforms, accessed through secure dark-web browsers, like Tor.\nAnother factor contributing to Bitcoin’s early privacy, however, is that the technology remained siloed in it’s earliest years, segregated from regulated financial infrastructure, and “under the radar” of intelligence organizations. For example, the creator and operator of one of the most prolific darknet Bitcoin marketplaces, the Silk Road, was identified and arrested in 2013, after just two years of successfully maintaining anonymity through pseudonymity.\nThe key realization here is that Bitcoin offers a permissionless and censorship-resistant method of transacting value - nothing else. In order to protect one’s identity in the applications of Bitcoin, one must rely on the other components of the technology stack to provide the privacy guarantees to maintain anonymity. Any if any single OpSec mistake were to be made, everything about the user’s pseudonym could be revealed.\nThe consequences of Bitcoin’s intra-network transparency were difficult to identify in its early life - Bitcoin seemed privacy-preserving. Fast-forward 13 years, however, and the ability to surveil couldn’t be more clear.\nAccording to recent reports, approximately 46 million Americans (~22% of US population) own some form of Bitcoin. Out of this, it’s estimated that at least 8/10 purchased and/or hold their Bitcoin through a KYC’d account on a custodied platform, such as Coinbase, Crypto[dot]com, or Robinhood. From this alone, the Bitcoin-specific financial information off nearly all US persons (not just the ones with KYC’d accounts) is effectively public. These entities are obligated to release Customer data if provoked on legal grounds, and sophisticated players can retreive this information even in the case Coinbase were to remain non-compliant.\nThe Bitcoin protocol, when integrated with 3rd party KYC applications (as it is today and will be throughout the foreseeable future), is a near-perfect protocol for financial surveillance."

    "text": "Turing-Complete Blockchains\n\nTuring-Complete Computation + Weak Privacy = Infinite Surveillance\nIn the section above, I have only discussed the (lack of) privacy offered by Bitcoin - I have not argued for whether these facts are “good” or “bad”. Perhaps this was all part of Satoshi’s grand vision, and it is ethically optimal for financial settlement infrastructure to offer complete transparency. I will continue to avoid the question of good or bad as it pertains to Bitcoin, because I, myself, am not certain in my stance.\nWhen the question extends to Turing-Complete networks, however, I have enough convinction to argue that zero-privacy guarantees are suboptimal.\nIn 2014, a novel smart contract based, Turing-Complete blockchain protocol called Ethereum was introduced. Ethereum allowed for arbitrary code executions, enabling application development beyond just the transfer of the native asset. Over the past several years, there has been an explosion of Ethereum application development. From domain name services to gaming/social apps, these applications span beyond just payments - logging data, provoking external program executions, developing on-chain reputation/identity, and establishing organizational structures of accounts.\n\nPower tends to corrupt; absolute power corrupts absolutely\n\nJust like Bitcoin, all data associated with Ethereum transactions, by default, are stored on the public ledger in plaintext for anyone to view. With countless “decentralized” profile-based applications, the connection between an on-chain pseudonym and corresponding government identity is increasingly inevitable. Additionally, every action, transaction, and application interaction performed on Ethereum further develops the user’s on-chain reputation, permanently documented on Ethereum’s immutable global ledger. Even if the goal was not to maintain a distinction between on-chain and “real” identities, a lack of privacy for the on-chain identity inevitably approaches a lack of privacy in real life.\n\nCalling an Uber\nBuying an engagement ring (or organizing a surprise party)\nAny healthcare-related activites\n\nUpon meditating on the consequences of an extension of this paradigm, one may encounter a seemingly endless array of dystopian scenarios."

    "text": "Conclusion\nAs Vitalik Buterin voiced, the “Holy Grail” blockchain technology would allow users to benefit from the security of a blockchain, using a decentralized network to process the transactions, but “encrypting” the data in such a way that even though everything is being computed in plain sight, the underlying “meaning” of the information is completely obfuscated.\nToday’s blockchains lack privacy because distributed consensus mechanisms rely on the verifiability of blockchain data, which currently requires plaintext data. There exist exciting fields of cryptographic research in pursuit of solving this issue - my personal favorites are Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) and Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE).\nHowever, the integration of privacy-enabling primitives is time-sensitive. Deferring essential features to later appensions to the technology often results in weaker guarantees of the respective features. Additionally, as societal adoption increases over time, the community is more likely to become distanced from the ethos from which the technology was birthed.\n\nFrom my earliest days I had a passion for science. But science, the exercise of the supreme power of the human intellect, was always linked in my mind with benefit to people. I saw science as being in harmony with humanity. I did not imagine that the second half of my life would be spent on efforts to avert a mortal danger to humanity created by science.\n\nI hope the topic of privacy remains at the forefront of blockchain research. We must actively ensure that the innovation of distributed computing serves to benefit society: for this is not guaranteed."

    "text": "Context\nAt 17, I enrolled at the University of Pennsylvania to study Computer Science in the School of Engineering. Throughout my first year, Wharton’s presence, and seeming cultural importance, highlighted that my primary education left me with no concept of what it meant to study “Business”. In a refusal to accept this ingorance, I applied to the Wharton School, and ended up concentrating in quantitative finance.\nIn the Spring of 2021, I worked as an intern for an active, multi-strategy New York family office. Within the first month of my internship, I discovered MEV in blockchain networks. For the next few months, I pursued “searching” (the act of axtracting MEV): learning the Solidity and Golang programming languages from scratch, familiarizing myself with the Ethereum Virutal Machine, and developing infrastructure to automate on-chain arbitrage monitoring, and execution.\nTowards the end of the Summer, I was offered a full time role. I continued my job as I return to UPenn that Fall, spending much of my time in New York when I wasn’t playing football in Philadelphia. My grades suffered, but it was worth it. I learned far more in the arena that I did in the classroom, and my journey in MEV was fruitful, to say the least.\nAmong the requirements for my Engineering degree was the “Senior Thesis”, which I completed that Fall. I decided, of course, to write my thesis on the work I was doing professionally."

As the adoption of smart contract platforms continues to grow, the implications of on-chain arbitrage dynamics are increasingly important.\nIn this paper, I explore the concept of Maximal Extractable Value, and investigate the evolution of the space since the term was coined by Daian et al. in 2019.\nI identify three categories of MEV: Single-Domain Atomic MEV, Single- Domain Non-Atomic MEV (also known as long-tail MEV), and Cross- Domain MEV (which is inherently non-atomic). I show that Single-Domain Non-Atomic MEV strategies have yielded over $10 million USD of extracted value on the Ethereum network in just the last six months. This paper also explores the future potential for cross-domain arbitrage in a multi-chain economic ecosystem with a high level evaluation of the key logic.\nMy work aims to highlight the importance of MEV as a concept within distributed systems, and also includes a brief discussion of the ethical im- plications of the subject."
