    "text": "A case study on the history of money\n\nContext\nBy the 6th century B.C., Western money standards began to converge around the use of stamped metal coins. One of the earliest dominant currencies was the Athenian silver tetradrachm, which gained dominance over the gold/silver coins issued by Persia and other western empires of the time. Aside from the economic success and naval hegemony of ancient Athens, factors contributing to the currency’s success were large circulating supply, fine quality, and unchanging appearance. Nevertheless, the “dominance” of Athenian money was limited, as dozens of currencies remained in use in local circulation.\n\n\nThe Rise of Rome, and the Globalization of Money\nFollowing the rise of the Roman Empire, the introduction of the Roman silver denarius around 211 B.C. marked a turning point in Western money. The denarius effectively fixed the previously-fluctuating relationship between silver and bronze, with one silver denarius (containing ~4.5g of silver) exchangeable for 10 bronze asses, (the as was a bronze coin of the time). Gold was used less frequently, until Julius Ceasar standardized the gold aureus (8g of gold) to 25 denarii. The success of Roman imperialism expanded adoption of the aureus/denarius/as standard farther than any currency prior. Rome effectively established the (Western) globalization of hard money.\nThese currencies and their respective exchange rates remained impressively stable through the turmoil caused by the assassination of Julius Ceasar in 44 B.C. Many historians credit the strength of Roman money as a crucial foundation for the 200-year golden age of Rome, known as the Pax Romana, which lasted from 27 B.C. to 170 A.D.\n\n\nCoin Clipping: The Beginning of the End\nAround the middle of the Pax Romana, however, Emperor Nero made a monetary decision that, in retrospect, appears to mark the beginning of the end of Roman economic prowess. When faced with increasing government expenditures, Emperor Nero became the first to engage in what is known as coin clipping: the emperor would recall the coins then mint them into a new coin with a lower metallic content but with the same face value. This is currency debasement - it marked the introduction of government-induced inflation in Rome.\nIt’s important to note that currency debasement proved to be successful in the short term. The decision to begin coin clipping may be responsible for successfully extending the period of Roman peace, as over the reign of the next several Emperors, economic prosperity and peace continued as inflation remained below half a percent.\nOver the next two hundred years, however, it became clear that the temporary relief provided by currency debasement (coin clipping) would eventually demand further debasement. Rome was permanently prohibited from returning to a non-inflationary economy, and thus engaged in a vicious cycle:\ncurrency debasement → price increases → price controls → further debasement\nIn the long run, coin clipping only increased the magnitude of the problems Emperor Nero set to solve. This cycle ravaged Rome through centuries of political and economic instability, until Constantine managed to restore stability through significant monetary reform.\n\n\nHard Money to the Rescue… Too Late\nConstantine issued the gold solidus in 312 A.D. at a weight of 4.55 grams, permanently replacing the aureus. The solidus was worth 275,000 debased denarii, which now contained ~5% silver, down from the original 95%.\nConstantine required the fixed weight of the solidus, without debasement, which finally established Roman economic stability.\nThe recovery of the Roman economy came too late, as continuing foreign invasions led to the collapse of the Western Roman Empire. However, the gold solidus was so successful that it remained the currency of the Byzantine Empire (Eastern Rome) centuries after the fall of the Western Empire. To this day, the gold solidus remains a candidate for the most successful currency in the history of the world.\n\n\nSources\nInflation Under the Roman Empire\nMoney and Prices in the Ancient Roman Empire\nMoney and Exchange in the Roman World\nThe Monetary Systems of the Roman Empire from Diocletian to Theodosius I\nRome: A Thousand Years of Monetary History"

    "text": "Cypherpunks\nThe commonality of this misconception may be explained, at least in part, by the founding culture associated with blockchain technology. Blockchain technology emerged in the late 20th century from several key innovations in the field of cryptography, the same field from which the manifestation of informational privacy (encryption), was pioneered.\nThe Cypherpunks were a group of cryptographic enthusiasts who advocated for the use of cryptography and similar methods as ways to achieve societal and political change. Founded in the early 1990s, the movement has been most active during the 1990s “cryptowars” and following the 2011 internet spring. The Cypherpunks forecasted the coming age of digital information, and saw cryptography as a means of preserving fundamental individual rights, such privacy and self-sovereignty. Members of this group include Roger Dingledine, co-founder of the Tor Project, Julian Assange, founder of Wikileaks, and perhaps most notably, Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin.\nMany of the protocols, algorithms, and applications developed by the Cypherpunks were centered around privacy. Bitcoin was not."

    "section": "The Genesis Case Study, Bitcoin",
    "text": "The Genesis Case Study, Bitcoin\n\nPseudonymity != Anonymity\nIn October of 2008, an email from Satoshi Nakamoto was sent to the cypherpunk email list, titled “Bitcoin P2P e-cash paper”.\nParticipation in the Bitcoin network only requires a public/private keypair (ECDSA for Version 1). There is no support for “accounts” or “profiles” which include other metadata, such as name, email, address, etc. Thus, the Bitcoin network is inherently pseudonymous, where the pseudonyms are Bitcoin addresses (smaller hashed versions of the public key). On the Bitcoin network, all transactions are published to and stored on the public ledger (this allows for Bitcoin’s distributed consensus), making intra-network forensics trivial. I.e. it is trivial to retreive the entire financial history of 1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa, and verifiably gather information on all transactions involving this address, neighboring addresses, etc.\nStill, it remains theoretically possible to use Bitcoin anonymously. A Bitcoin user may rely on proper operational security (OpSec) techniques to ensure his/her Bitcoin pseudonym remains entirely disjunct from his/her “real” or government identity. In the early days of Bitcoin, the majority of participants did successfully maintain anonymity through proper OpSec - accessing the network through VPNs, public WiFi hotspots, remote SSH tunneling, etc.\nOne factor contributing to the early success of anonymity was the fact that the earliest users of Bitcoin were often well-versed in digital OpSec. Early users generated and custodied their keypairs on a local and/or secure machine because they were familiar with ECDSA encryption, and they executed Bitcoin payments under anonymous identities on secure e-commerce platforms, accessed through secure dark-web browsers, like Tor.\nAnother factor contributing to Bitcoin’s early privacy, however, is that the technology remained siloed in it’s earliest years, segregated from regulated financial infrastructure, and “under the radar” of intelligence organizations. For example, the creator and operator of one of the most prolific darknet Bitcoin marketplaces, the Silk Road, was identified and arrested in 2013, after just two years of successfully maintaining anonymity through pseudonymity.\nThe key realization here is that Bitcoin offers a permissionless and censorship-resistant method of transacting value - nothing else. In order to protect one’s identity in the applications of Bitcoin, one must rely on the other components of the technology stack to provide the privacy guarantees to maintain anonymity. Any if any single OpSec mistake were to be made, everything about the user’s pseudonym could be revealed.\nThe consequences of Bitcoin’s intra-network transparency were difficult to identify in its early life - Bitcoin seemed privacy-preserving. Fast-forward 13 years, however, and the ability to surveil couldn’t be more clear.\nAccording to recent reports, approximately 46 million Americans (~22% of US population) own some form of Bitcoin. Out of this, it’s estimated that at least 8/10 purchased and/or hold their Bitcoin through a KYC’d account on a custodied platform, such as Coinbase, Crypto[dot]com, or Robinhood. From this alone, the Bitcoin-specific financial information off nearly all US persons (not just the ones with KYC’d accounts) is effectively public. These entities are obligated to release Customer data if provoked on legal grounds, and sophisticated players can retreive this information even in the case Coinbase were to remain non-compliant.\nThe Bitcoin protocol, when integrated with 3rd party KYC applications (as it is today and will be throughout the foreseeable future), is a near-perfect protocol for financial surveillance."

    "text": "Turing-Complete Blockchains\n\nTuring-Complete Computation + Weak Privacy = Infinite Surveillance\nIn the section above, I have only discussed the (lack of) privacy offered by Bitcoin - I have not argued for whether these facts are “good” or “bad”. Perhaps this was all part of Satoshi’s grand vision, and it is ethically optimal for financial settlement infrastructure to offer complete transparency. I will continue to avoid the question of good or bad as it pertains to Bitcoin, because I, myself, am not certain in my stance.\nWhen the question extends to Turing-Complete networks, however, I have enough convinction to argue that zero-privacy guarantees are suboptimal.\nIn 2014, a novel smart contract based, Turing-Complete blockchain protocol called Ethereum was introduced. Ethereum allowed for arbitrary code executions, enabling application development beyond just the transfer of the native asset. Over the past several years, there has been an explosion of Ethereum application development. From domain name services to gaming/social apps, these applications span beyond just payments - logging data, provoking external program executions, developing on-chain reputation/identity, and establishing organizational structures of accounts.\n\nPower tends to corrupt; absolute power corrupts absolutely\n\nJust like Bitcoin, all data associated with Ethereum transactions, by default, are stored on the public ledger in plaintext for anyone to view. With countless “decentralized” profile-based applications, the connection between an on-chain pseudonym and corresponding government identity is increasingly inevitable. Additionally, every action, transaction, and application interaction performed on Ethereum further develops the user’s on-chain reputation, permanently documented on Ethereum’s immutable global ledger. Even if the goal was not to maintain a distinction between on-chain and “real” identities, a lack of privacy for the on-chain identity inevitably approaches a lack of privacy in real life.\n\nCalling an Uber\nBuying an engagement ring (or organizing a surprise party)\nAny healthcare-related activites\n\nUpon meditating on the consequences of an extension of this paradigm, one may encounter a seemingly endless array of dystopian scenarios."

    "section": "Conclusion",
    "text": "Conclusion\nAs Vitalik Buterin voiced, the “Holy Grail” blockchain technology would allow users to benefit from the security of a blockchain, using a decentralized network to process the transactions, but “encrypting” the data in such a way that even though everything is being computed in plain sight, the underlying “meaning” of the information is completely obfuscated.\nToday’s blockchains lack privacy because distributed consensus mechanisms rely on the verifiability of blockchain data, which currently requires plaintext data. There exist exciting fields of cryptographic research in pursuit of solving this issue - my personal favorites are Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) and Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE).\nHowever, the integration of privacy-enabling primitives is time-sensitive. Deferring essential features to later appensions to the technology often results in weaker guarantees of the respective features. Additionally, as societal adoption increases over time, the community is more likely to become distanced from the ethos from which the technology was birthed.\n\nFrom my earliest days I had a passion for science. But science, the exercise of the supreme power of the human intellect, was always linked in my mind with benefit to people. I saw science as being in harmony with humanity. I did not imagine that the second half of my life would be spent on efforts to avert a mortal danger to humanity created by science.\n\nI hope the topic of privacy remains at the forefront of blockchain research. We must actively ensure that the innovation of distributed computing serves to benefit society: for this is not guaranteed."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Background\nI’ve spent a some time meditating on this question. I have interacted with the industry as a consumer, as an investor, as a startup contributor, and as a (novice) developer. Most importantly, I’ve had fruitful discussions with, and have listened very carefully to, many people with more perspectives than I.\nThat’s not to say my views are necessarily important, or even correct - it’s just a bit of context. I remain open-minded, and I welcome discussion, counter-points, and new information…\nI see two main, distinct vectors of risk\n\nLoss of Human Dominance\nCentralization of Information Flow\n\n\n\nLoss of Human Dominance\nThe first and most focused on vector of risk is the danger of a(n) agent(s) which surpass(es) humans in intelligence & aptitude. This is the rogue AGI scenario. Humans have held the top spot for ~300,000 years, and no one is capable of predicting what would happen if/when that changes.\nThis is the vector addressed by “Pause Giant AI Experiments: An Open Letter” https://futureoflife.org/open-letter/pause-giant-ai-experiments/\nI believe this vector of risk is real, and it is tremendously dangerous.\nCybersecurity will become very tricky. https://twitter.com/0xbmac/status/1664668707820273669?s=20\nMilitary applications will introduce existential threats https://academic.oup.com/ijlit/article-pdf/30/4/472/49978077/eaad008.pdf\nDomestic use cases (surveillance, policing) will yield tremendous controversy\nIn my opinion, the day-to-day news stories/headlines draw too much attention and cause us to overestimate the short-term risks. Yet, the longer term horizon of this paradigm remain wildly under-appreciated.\nRegardless of my (or anyone’s) view on the severity of this risk vector, it’s naive to think a “pause” on AI will ever happen.\nThis is an arms race.\n\n\nCentralization of Information Flow\nThe second vector of risk, which I believe is more relevant in the short-term, regards what’s being referred to as the “Moderation Layer”.\nThis risk is not about the AI agent itself. Rather, it concerns the humans & organizations that own these models and are responsible for regulating (or in the position to regulate) usage. Although discussion on the correct approach to regulation/moderation takes place, these often happen in the political realm, wherein a strictly two-dimensional tug-of-war stagnates.\nMain Question: What is the goal of the moderation layer, and why is it necessary?\n\n“To censor dangerous content” - What exactly defines “dangerous”? - Would a blanket definition of “dangerous” be acceptable? For example, allowing an AI explain how to enrich Uranium to a jihadist group can likely be considered dangerous. Allowing the AI to explain this to a group of PhD Chemical Engineers, on the other hand, is not as dangerous.\n\n\n“To censor offensive content” - All statements are offensive to some extent, so where exactly are we drawing the line? To what extent should we be tolerant in the name of free speech? “Offensive” is a spectrum - there is no statement that offends none. It becomes clear to ask, to what extent are we willing to restrict the freedom of thought to protect users from being offended?\n\n\n“To limit the spread of misinformation” - I have a appreciation for the harm that AI can do with respect to proliferating false information. But if the past few years have taught us anything, it’s that “misinformation” is now synonymous with “I don’t like that information”.\n\nI am not going to assert my conclusions on these follow-ups to the main question. I believe there are no objective answers to these questions. Thus, they must be governed by a diverse body of humans.\nLarge language models (LLMs) like OpenAI’s GPT-4 are trained on billions of lines of text, extracted from the internet, from millions of (human) sources of various demographics, representing a vast array of perspectives.\nOpenAI’s moderation layer is built by less than 100 humans, nearly all of whom have a similar background and reside in Silicon Valley.\n“The political ideology of conversational AI” https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01768\nTo believe the latter is capable of mitigating the bias the former, in my humble opinion, is simply incorrect.\nGPT-4 System Card, the Appendix https://cdn.openai.com/papers/gpt-4-system-card.pdf\nI am not claiming the former (the agent) is unbiased. LLMs are trained heavily on text from Reddit, for example, which has an overrepresentation of men than women. Further, as (almost) all training data is extracted from the internet, the information from which the AI model “learns” is inherently biased towards the digital world: internet users, citizens of first world countries, etc.\nMy current stance is that the moderation layer is necessary, but\n\nThe implementation details of the moderation layer must be transparent.\nGovernance of the moderation layer must be, to some extent, decentralized. At the very least, let us agree the power should not lie solely in the hands of 0.00000125% of the world’s population."
