Bitcoin was not.\n\n## The Genesis Case Study, Bitcoin\n\n#### Pseudonymity != Anonymity\n\nIn October of 2008, an [email](https://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2008-October/014810.html) from Satoshi Nakamoto was sent to the [cypherpunk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypherpunk#:~:text=For%20a%20time%2C%20the%20cypherpunks,referred%20to%20as%20a%20mailbomber.) email list, titled \"Bitcoin P2P e-cash paper\".\n\nParticipation in the Bitcoin network only requires a public/private keypair (ECDSA for Version 1). There is no support for \"accounts\" or \"profiles\" which include other metadata, such as name, email, address, etc. Thus, the Bitcoin network is inherently pseudonymous, where the pseudonyms are Bitcoin addresses (smaller hashed versions of the public key). On the Bitcoin network, all transactions are published to and stored on the public ledger (this allows for Bitcoin's distributed consensus), making intra-network forensics trivial. I.e. it is trivial to retreive the entire financial history of `1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa`, and verifiably gather information on all transactions involving this address, neighboring addresses, etc.\n\nStill, it remains theoretically possible to use Bitcoin anonymously. A Bitcoin user may rely on proper operational security (OpSec) techniques to ensure his/her Bitcoin pseudonym remains entirely disjunct from his/her \"real\" or government identity. In the early days of Bitcoin, the majority of participants did successfully maintain anonymity through proper OpSec - accessing the network through VPNs, public WiFi hotspots, remote SSH tunneling, etc. \n\nOne factor contributing to the early success of anonymity was the fact that the earliest users of Bitcoin were often well-versed in digital OpSec. Early users generated and custodied their keypairs on a local and/or secure machine because they were familiar with ECDSA encryption, and they executed Bitcoin payments under anonymous identities on secure e-commerce platforms, accessed through secure dark-web browsers, like Tor. \n\nAnother factor contributing to Bitcoin's early privacy, however, is that the technology remained siloed in it's earliest years, segregated from regulated financial infrastructure, and \"under the radar\" of intelligence organizations. For example, the creator and operator of one of the most prolific darknet Bitcoin marketplaces, the Silk Road, was identified and arrested in 2013, after just two years of successfully maintaining anonymity through pseudonymity.\n\nThe key realization here is that Bitcoin offers a *permissionless* and *censorship-resistant* method of transacting value - nothing else. In order to protect one's identity in the applications of Bitcoin, one must rely on the other components of the technology stack to provide the privacy guarantees to maintain anonymity. Any if any *single* OpSec mistake were to be made, *everything* about the user's pseudonym could be revealed.\n\nThe consequences of Bitcoin's intra-network transparency were difficult to identify in its early life - Bitcoin *seemed* privacy-preserving. Fast-forward 13 years, however, and the ability to surveil couldn't be more clear. \n\nAccording to recent reports, approximately 46 million Americans (~22% of US population) own some form of Bitcoin. Out of this, it's estimated that at least 8/10 purchased and/or hold their Bitcoin through a KYC'd account on a custodied platform, such as Coinbase, Crypto[dot]com, or Robinhood. From this alone, the Bitcoin-specific financial information off nearly all US persons (not just the ones with KYC'd accounts) is effectively public. These entities are obligated to release Customer data if provoked on legal grounds, and sophisticated players can retreive this information even in the case Coinbase were to remain non-compliant.\n\nThe Bitcoin protocol, when integrated with 3rd party KYC applications (as it is today and will be throughout the foreseeable future), is a near-perfect protocol for financial surveillance.\n\n## Turing-Complete Blockchains\n\n#### Turing-Complete Computation + Weak Privacy = Infinite Surveillance\n\nIn the section above, I have only discussed the (lack of) privacy offered by Bitcoin - I have not argued for whether these facts are \"good\" or \"bad\". Perhaps this was all part of Satoshi's grand vision, and it is ethically optimal for financial settlement infrastructure to offer complete transparency. I will continue to avoid the question of good or bad as it pertains to Bitcoin, because I, myself, am not certain in my stance.\n\nWhen the question extends to Turing-Complete networks, however, I have enough convinction to argue that zero-privacy guarantees are suboptimal.\n\nIn 2014, a novel smart contract based, Turing-Complete blockchain protocol called Ethereum was [introduced](https://ethereum.org/669c9e2e2027310b6b3cdce6e1c52962/Ethereum_Whitepaper_-_Buterin_2014.pdf). Ethereum allowed for arbitrary code executions, enabling application development beyond just the transfer of the native asset. Over the past several years, there has been an explosion of Ethereum application development.

Additionally, every action, transaction, and application interaction performed on Ethereum further develops the user's on-chain reputation, permanently documented on Ethereum's immutable global ledger. Even if the goal was not to maintain a distinction between on-chain and \"real\" identities, a lack of privacy for the on-chain identity inevitably approaches a lack of privacy in real life.\n\n- Calling an Uber\n- Buying an engagement ring (or organizing a surprise party)\n- Any healthcare-related activites\n\nUpon meditating on the consequences of an extension of this paradigm, one may encounter a seemingly endless array of dystopian scenarios.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAs Vitalik Buterin [voiced](https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/01/15/privacy-on-the-blockchain), the \"Holy Grail\" blockchain technology would allow users to benefit from the security of a blockchain, using a decentralized network to process the transactions, but \"encrypting\" the data in such a way that even though everything is being computed in plain sight, the underlying \"meaning\" of the information is completely obfuscated.\n\nToday's blockchains lack privacy because distributed consensus mechanisms rely on the verifiability of blockchain data, which currently requires plaintext data.
